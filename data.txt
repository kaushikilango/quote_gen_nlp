Just ignore now, their special need and / Allow your weakness / Look at my face and be the witness of my / Strange world
Raise to new awareness / Individual way of life / A dated philosophy / Youth runs amok
Raised to future awareness / Manipulation has failed / Rulers leaders / Anarchy will prevail now
Awareness, the fruit of life / Awareness and happiness 
The bedrock of existence / A philosophical schism / Aware of its own awareness / Panpsychism 
Goal of evolution, which grants the benefits of added awareness with / Unlimited boundness of happiness, also known as bliss
Awareness, becoming one with the longing for complete surrender to the / Higher self, which has potentially been waiting these long eons of time
Then I'll be smiling. / They litter me with small awareness! / Then they ask if I'm good enough / They litter me with small awareness / Just to wake me up / Why do the fools wake me up?
Mellowed by tones that calm the air / Shelters my nerves from awareness's lair / So comfortable with this ill-informed bliss / Close off reality with ignorance's kiss
And there's wisdom in awareness man existence just a trip / As I'm thinking in the clouds and I'm blazing a spliff / Tomorrow ain't promised, how many days did you live 
I bring awareness to my body as I'm breathing in / I give my thanks cause one day I might be leaving it
The grace that comes from simply being / Is an ineffable energy / Yet awareness dances 'round itself / Distracted from finding true peace and purpose
When I invite your awareness inside / I want to witness your love / And let it cleanse this sin / I want to keep this youth and remain free
As you gain awareness and search for what is beyond /The light within brightens your path to contentment / I swear this fire won't burn / Skies screech bereave this universe
Know that you will find your own truth, your own path in your own way / Be free of material / True awareness comes from within

Overflowing senses / Heightened awareness / I hear my blood flow / I feel its caress / Whispering cosmos / Talking right to me / Unlimited, endless / God breathing through me

And I stood above the burdens that puzzle you and me. / I became awareness that was shared with all around, / With the trees, the sky, the flowers, and the wind, the sun, the ground.
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side / Today I know that we are the same / Are the same, you and I / Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
A joy, a depression, a meanness / Some momentary awareness comes / As an unexpected visitor
In the dark of awareness / The arena of the blind / The hell you see is nearer than you think
What once was / I wish no longer be / Fear of separation is no more / One cosmic breath-the whole eternity / Unbroken flow of awareness conquers entropy
One day with a smile a wound will heal / And with awareness feel / The Universe to shine / One day when immensity is near / This man will conquer fear

It's time to get to work / I challenge you to work / There's no secret about this / You reap what you sow
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you / Be more than words / Be more than strength and kind / Be love and blind / To those who come to you
It's the eye of the tiger / It's the thrill of the fight / Rising up to the challenge / Of our rival 
Listen as your day unfolds / Challenge what the future holds / Try and keep your head up to the sky
When you grasped the question / Did you miss the meaning? / When you met your challenge / Did you go out fighting? / We will discover / Ripeness twice over?
Thousands of lives wasting away / People living from day to day / It's a challenge just staying alive
Colored in pastures of chance / Dancing leaves cast spells of challenge / Amused but real in thought / We fled from the sea whole
Faced with a challenge of finding right and wrong / In a brand new world that recognizes none / It's hard for me to believe in all my travels / I'm the only one
Another journey for me / Another challenge to win / I'm here again to complete / My mission impossible / I'm not ready to die / The fear's become my ally
The more that you think you ain't getting to the end / Focus on the challenge / And it will begin
We're fighting tooth and nail / Our backs may be against the wall / But there's no way we can fail / Rising to the challenge / Take our chances with both hands
If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams / That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
But balance is good / The world isn't fair / The challenge is great / It's bitter and sweet / Just balance the hate
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger / One more reason to turn up on them
Find your challenge, suffer miles / Colors gray, he brings them out / Don't mind the challenge, suffer miles / A little shallow, if I don't say

They take the challenge to their hearts / Challenging preconceived ideas / Saying goodbye to long standing fears
Shallow dreams undone / Fruitless and unsung / No challenge towers so steep / Seven horses deep 
But at my heels there’s a strong wind that blows / I’ll celebrate the highs and learn from the lows, / And face the challenges of life, / With my shoulders back and my head held high
Which challenges itself as honors born, / And is not like the sire: honors thrive, / When rather from our acts we them derive, / Than our fore-goers

The footing was really atrocious. I loved it. I really like cross country; you’re one with the mud.

All runners burn some cards when running at their marathon or half marathon pace.

The man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win.

The five S's of sports training are: stamina, speed, strength, skill, and spirit; but the greatest of these is spirit.
Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.
It doesn't matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you better be running.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
The long run is what puts the tiger in the cat.
The body does not want you to do this. As you run, it tells you to stop but the mind must be strong. You always go too far for your body. You must handle the pain with strategy...It is not age; it is not diet. It is the will to succeed.
If you want to become the best runner you can be, start now. Don't spend the rest of your life wondering if you can do it.
Sweat cleanses from the inside. It comes from places a shower will never reach.
To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.
The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare.
My whole feeling in terms of racing is that you have to be very bold. You sometimes have to be aggressive and gamble.

The marathon can humble you.
A lot of people don't realize that about 98 percent of the running I put in is anything but glamorous: 2 percent joyful participation, 98 percent dedication! It's a tough formula. Getting out in the forest in the biting cold and the flattening heat, and putting in kilometer after kilometer.
It hurts up to a point and then it doesn't get any worse.
Mind is everything. Muscle - pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.
Art is nothing more than the shadow of humanity.
My motto is: feel the fear and do it anyway.
Who runs in circles never gets far.
I prefer running without shoes. My toes didn't get cold. Besides, if I'm in front from the start, no one can step on them.
School cross country runs started because the rugby pitches were flooded. There was an alternative: extra studying. This meant there were plenty of runners on sports afternoons.
It doesn't matter whether you come in first, in the middle of the pack, or last. You can say, 'I have finished.' There is a lot of satisfaction in that.
Big occasions and races which have been eagerly anticipated almost to the point of dread, are where great deeds can be accomplished.
Everyone in life is looking for a certain rush. Racing is where I get mine.
Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
One thing about racing is that it hurts. You better accept that from the beginning or you’re not going anywhere.

Cities force growth, and make men talkative and entertaining, but they make them artificial.
Cities with all their advantages have something hostile to liberal learning, the seductions are so subtle and accost the senses so openly on all sides.

A soulless city creates soulless people!
The single most important thing a city can do is provide a community where interesting, smart people want to live with their families.

It's been amazing getting to go from city to city and perform for thousands of people. It's an amazing feeling, and the energy is crazy.
We will neglect our cities to our peril, for in neglecting them we neglect the nation.
The city is a fact in nature, like a cave, a run of mackerel or an ant-heap. But it is also a conscious work of art, and it holds within its communal framework many simpler and more personal forms of art. Mind takes form in the city; and in turn, urban forms condition mind.
What I like about cities is that everything is king size, the beauty and the ugliness.
It is in the midst of the city that one writes the most inspiring pages about the country.
A city is a place where there is no need to wait for next week to get the answer to a question, to taste the food of any country, to find new voices to listen to and familiar ones to listen to again.

All that a city will ever allow you is an angle on it -- an oblique, indirect sample of what it contains, or what passes through it; a point of view.

There is much to love and to admire in the great city. It is the home of the highest achievements of man and art, literature and science: the source from which the forces of freedom and emancipation have sprung.

Farewell! thou busy city, / Amid whose changing throng I’ve passed a pleasant sojourn, / Though wearisome and long. My soul is sad at leaving / The dear ones, not a few, / I've met within thy mazes, / So noble and so true.

Different cities boil within each of us. There is so much we hate — the dirt, the poverty, the prejudice; there is so much we love — the one or two friendships that somehow crossed boundaries, the libraries where we joined ourselves to the dreams of others, the places where we compose dreams of our own, the museums where we learned how to defeat time, certain streets, alleys staircases, apartment-house roofs, certain radio stations we would listen to deep into the night, certain newspapers we read as if they were a testament to the ages. We remember the terrors and joys of our early urban wanderings.

The city, inhabited by these memories of mine, moves not only backwards into art history, started by the great names which mark every station of recorded time, but also back and forth in the living present, so to speak — among its contemporary faiths and races; the hundred little spheres which religion or lore creates and which cohere softly together like the cells to form the great sprawling jellyfish which is Alexandria today.
The city is not all bad nor all good. It is humanity compressed, the best and the worst combined, in a strangely composite community.
A city has values as well as slums, excitement as well as conflict; it has a personality that has not yet been obliterated by its highways and gas stations; it has a spirit as well as a set of arteries and a voice that speaks the hopes as well as the disappointments of its people.
Hail the glorious Golden City, / Pictured by the seers of old! / Everlasting light shines o'er it, / Wondrous tales of it are told.
Cities should be walled with the courage of their inhabitants.
Everyone relies on the city and all the public services that it contains. If we have concluded rightly, from what the philosophers say, that cities owe their origin and their existence to their enabling their inhabitants to enjoy a peaceful life, as freed from any inconvenience or harm as possible, then surely the most thorough consideration should be given to the city's layout, site, and outline.
Not houses finely roofed or the stones of walls well-builded, nay nor canals and dockyards, make the city, bur men able to use their opportunity.

Certainly our city — with the byres of poverty down to / The river's edge, the cathedral, the engines, the dogs; / Here is the cosmopolitan cooking / And the light allows and the glass. / Built by the conscious-stricken, the weapon-making. / By us.
To build the City where / The will of love is done / And brought to its full flower / The dignity of man.
Towns can be trusted to corrupt themselves.
Every day in the city, on the contrary — and I grew up in the city — involves a subtle divorce from reality. There is something a little terrifying about being forty stories in the air and looking around you, and you see nothing but walls, other skyscrapers, and you don't dare look down. And if you are on the ground, if you want to see the sky, you must make an effort of the will and look up. And if you do that, you are likely to be carried off to Bellevue — but that is another story.
No one in the city, except your immediate family — not always they— says good morning.

It is a great evil in the city that people are cut off from nature and communion with nature, so that they who would like to enjoy the sights and scenes and blessings of nature can do so only on rare occasions and by taking a journey.

The city is the only place where true diversity can thrive and where specialization can reach its apogee.
The essence of the ideal city is that a wide variety of individuals living in it have a clear chance to live a richly individualistic life if they want to; and I project this still further to include in the essence the stipulation that the humane city shall itself have individuality.
Our relations with cities are like our relations with people. We love them, hate them, or are indifferent toward them. On our first day in a city that is new to us, we go looking for the city. We go down this street, around that corner. We are aware of the faces of passers-by. But the city eludes us, and we become uncertain whether we are looking for a city, or for a person.
Can the mind have a greater pleasure than contemplating the rise and progress of cities and kingdoms?
The city, is constantly drawing from the country the young men and women of ambition and self-reliance, who are lured thither by the great prizes which in a democracy are open to the competition of all.

The theory of the city somehow cannot account for what every journalist, poet, and novelist knows — the city is a living thing.
There are moments in every city dawn when the circles, rectangles, polygons, and triangles — the geometry of the city — seem to float in the mist, like the essence of the human spirit emancipated from the earth. There are times, on starlit nights, when its towers and spires ram upward as if to tear the darkness loose from its riveting stars and the city seems to be a strident assertion of mankind against time itself.

The city has more wealth than the country, more skill, more erudition within its bounds, more initiative, more philanthropy, more science, more divorces, more aliens, more births and deaths, more accidents, more rich, more poor, more wise men and more fools.
The city magnifies, spreads out, and advertises human nature in all its various manifestations. It is this that makes the city interesting, even fascinating. It is this, however, that makes it of all places the one in which to discover the secrets of human hearts, and to study human nature and society.
[The city] has always been the fireplace of civilization, whence light and heat radiated out into the dark.
Yes, I went to the city / And there I did bitterly cry, / Men our of touch with the earth, / And with never a glance at the sky.
The beautiful city, the city of hurried and sparkling waters! the city of spires and masts! / The city nested in bays! my city! / The city of such women, I am mad with them! I will return after death to be with them! / The city of such young men, I swear I cannot live happy, without I often go talk, walk, eat, drink, sleep, with them!
The only credential the city asked was the boldness to dream. For those who did, it unlocked its gates and its treasures, not
caring who they were or where they came from.
The city is itself a huge market. You can't go more than a few steps without finding a store of some sort. We are all potential entrepreneurs, looking to make a deal in this country of commerce.
For us who live in cities Nature is not natural. Nature is supernatural. Just as monks watched and strove to get a glimpse of heaven, so we watch and strive to get a glimpse of earth. It is as if men had cake and wine every day but were sometimes allowed common bread.
Our world is evolving without consideration, and the result is a loss of biodiversity, energy issues, congestion in cities. But geography, if used correctly, can be used to redesign sustainable and more livable cities.
He worked like hell in the country so he could live in the city, where he worked like hell so he could live in the country.

There was a certain something about the air in the city. You got the feeling that it was air that had seen life. You couldn’t help noting with every breath that thousands of other people were very close to you and nearly all of them had armpits.
Baby this town rips the bones from your back / It’s a death trap, it’s a suicide rap
The really great visual experience today is to fly over a huge city and look down into the night. It's like a tremendous jubilant Christmas tree. You just feel life is worth living — when you come down you may have some doubts.
But maybe I too have been stuck in this bad marriage too long, hopelessly in love not with the city, the hard economic realities of it, the years of being part of the crowd, but with the skyline, that suggestion in lights that this place is both unreachable and a goal. That it is, in short, poetry. That is the city that pulls me, the city I carry around in my head.
Street lights on fire / Couldn't get much higher / This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you yeah
Cause this city is my city / And I love it, yeah I love it / I was born and raised here / I got it made here / And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay here / For life, uh huh
Hot town, summer in the city / Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty / Been down, isn't it a pity / Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
Neon heart, day-glo eyes / The city lit by fireflies / They're advertising in the skies / For people like us
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city, / Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty / How can you lose? The lights are much brighter there...
I saw at night the City's lights shine bright, / A greater milky way; how in its spell / It fascinated with ten thousand eyes; / Like those sweet wiles of an enchantress who / Would still detain her knight gone cold in love
I saw that City with fierce human surge, / With millions of dark waves that still spread out / To swallow more of their green boundaries.
Beautiful city, the centre and crater of European confusion, / O you with your passionate shriek for the rights of an equal / humanity, / How often your Re-volution has proven but E-volution / Roll’d again back on itself in the tides of a civic insanity!
City of orgies, walks and joys! / City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make / you illustrious,
And when the hours of rest / Come, like a calm upon the mid-sea brine, / Hushing its billowy breast — / The quiet of that moment too is thine; / It breathes of him who keeps / The vast and helpless city while it sleeps.
Even here do I behold / Thy steps, Almighty! — here, amidst the crowd, / Through the great city rolled, / With everlasting murmur deep and loud — / Choking the ways that wind / 'Mongst the proud piles, the work of humankind.
City of twilight, / City that projects into the west, / City whose columns rest upon the sunset, city of square, threatening / masses blocking out the light: / City of twilight, / Wrap me in your folds of shadow.
The Beautiful City! Forever / Its rapturous praises resound; / We fain would behold it — but never / A glimpse of its dory is found:
The Beautiful City! O mortal, / Fare hopefully on in thy quest, / Pass down through the green grassy portal / That leads to the Valley of Rest;
You will find no new lands, you will find no other seas. / The city will follow you. You will roam the same / streets. And you will age in the same neighborhoods; / and you will grow gray in these same houses.
City of God, how broad and far / Outspread thy walls sublime! / The true thy chartered freemen are, / Of every age and clime.
And from the city comes the chimes — // We have our heaven on earthv — sometimes! 
For one brief golden moment rare like wine, / The gracious city swept across the line;
The great, proud city, seized with a strange love, / Bowed down for one flame hour my pride to prove.
Cities are like puppies. You see them writhing in agony on the street, you put them down. You don't let them suffer.

Every loss recapitulates earlier losses, but every affirmation of identity echoes earlier moments of clarity.

In depression this faith in deliverance, in ultimate restoration, is absent. The pain is unrelenting, and what makes the condition intolerable is the foreknowledge that no remedy will come — not in a day, an hour, a month, or a minute . . . And this results in a striking experience — one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded.

I touch no one and no one touches me.

Having depression is like being trapped in a really bad thunderstorm. You don't know when it's going to hit, you never know how long it's going to last, and when it finally passes, you're left to survey the damages and pick up the pieces.

I am so angry with myself because I cannot do what I should like to do, and at such a moment one feels as if one were lying bound hand and foot at the bottom of a deep dark well, utterly helpless.
The gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not an immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.
Sometimes one has simply to endure a period of depression for what it may hold of illumination if one can live through it, attentive to what it exposes or demands.

Everything passes away — suffering, pain, blood, hunger, pestilence. The sword will pass away too, but the stars will still remain when the shadows of our presence and our deeds have vanished from the earth. There is no man who does not know that. Why, then, will we not turn our eyes toward the stars? Why?
Depression is the flaw in love. To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair.
My depression had grown on me as that vine had conquered the oak; it had been a sucking thing that had wrapped itself around me, ugly and more alive than I. It had had a life of its own that bit by bit asphyxiated all of my life out of me. At the worst stage of major depression, I had moods that I knew were not my moods: they belonged to the depression, as surely as the leaves on that tree's high branches belonged to the vine.
I knew that the sun was rising and setting, but little of its light reached me. I felt myself sagging under what was much stronger than I; first I could not use my ankles, and then I could not control my knees, and then my waist began to break under the strain, and then my shoulders turned in, and in the end I was compacted and fetal, depleted by this thing that was crushing me without holding me. Its tendrils threatened to pulverize my mind and my courage and my stomach, and crack my bones and desiccate my body. It went on glutting itself on me when there seemed nothing left to feed it.
It wearies me, you say it wearies you; / But how I caught it, found it, or came by it / What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born / I am to learn; / And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, / That I have much ado to know myself.
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, / And Mourners to and fro / Kept treading — treading — till it seemed / That Sense was breaking through —
Instead of medication, / I want sunshine / & birdsongs / — the kind of laughter / that begins in my chest / & tumbles / out & across / my frame like waves / lapping at the shore of a beach.
Well, I can usually come our of it when I have the blues, / But now I'm so depressed that I have nothing more to lose.
Of course, despair is not your friend / or your enemy, you mustn't blame him! / He is your persistent creditor, and you? / You are the gambler with your soul as the stakes.
The sickness of desire, that in dark days / Looks on the imagination of despair, / Forgetteth man, and stinteth God his praise; / Nor but in sleep findeth a cure for care.
It gives, to think that our immortal being / No more shall need such garments; and yet man, / As long as he shall be the child of earth, / Might almost 'weep to have' what he may lose, / Nor be himself extinguished, but survive, / Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.
Oh, though oft depressed and lonely, / All my fears are laid aside, / If I but remember only / Such as these have lived and died!
There was no water in my eyes, but my spirits were depressed / And my heart lay like a sodden, soggy doughnut in my breast.
Dispirited became our friend — / Depressed his moral pecker — 
A grief that kept her ever brooding yet / And wholly melancholy and depressed, — / Nor yet could she find sleep by night nor rest / By day, for thinking — thinking — thinking still 
I sat depressed; till, later, / My Love came; / But something in the chamber / Dimmed our flame, — / An emanation, making our due words fall tame,
Exasperated, a drunk that sees things doubled, / I stumbled home, slammed the door, terrified, / sick, depressed, mind feverish and troubled, / wounded by mystery, the absurd, outside! / In vain my reason tried to take command, / its efforts useless in the tempest’s roar, / my soul, a mastless barge, danced, and danced, / over some monstrous sea without a shore!
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell / I know right now you can't tell / But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see / A different side of me / I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired / I know right now you don't care / But soon enough you're gonna think of me / And how I used to be, me
I'm holding on / Why is everything so heavy? / Holding on / So much more than I can carry / I keep dragging around what's bringing me down / If I just let go, I'd be set free
I don't like my mind right now / Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary / Wish that I could slow things down / I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
I never had a place to call my own / I never had a home / Ain't nobody callin' my phone / Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind? / They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
There are peaks, there are valleys. But they're all kind of carved and smoothed out, and it feels like a low level of despair you live in. Where you're not getting any answers, but you're living OK. And you can smile at the office. You know? But it's a low level of despair.
I look inside myself and see my heart is black / I see my red door and must have it painted black / maybe then I’ll fade away and not have to face the facts / it’s not easy facing up when your whole world is black
I hurt myself today / To see if I still feel / I focus on the pain / The only thing that's real / The needle tears a hole / The old familiar sting / Try to kill it all away / But I remember everything
There's a black crow sitting across from me / His wiry legs are crossed / He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss / Whatever could it be / That has brought me to this loss?
In my dark times I've still got some problems I know / Driving too fast but just moving to slow / And I've got something I've been trying to let go / Pulling me back every time
Every night I just want to go out, / Get out of my head / Every day I don't want to get up, / Get out of my bed
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow / No tomorrow, no tomorrow
All alone it was always there you see / And even on my own / It was always standing next to me / I can see it coming from the edge of the room / Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom / Can you see it coming now?
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels / I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills / And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf / No farewell / So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
The worst part of depression is that it dulls every positive feeling but intensifies every negative one. Joy is muted; sorrow is amplified.
Mom, my depression is a shape shifter / One day it is as small as a firefly in the palm of a bear / The next it's the bear / On those days I play dead until the bear leaves me alone

[D]epression is something real that one does not delete with the stroke of the pen. 
To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration, concentrate on the opposite vibration to the one to be suppressed... What is the source of sadness but feebleness of the mind? What gives it power but the want of reason? Rouse yourself to the combat, and it quits the field before you strike. 
Depression never brings me what I want; / My virtue will be warped and marred by it. / If there is a remedy when trouble strikes, / What reason is there for despondency? / And if there is no help for it, / What use is there in being sad?

Hopelessness can arise, I think, only from an inability to face the present, to live in the present, to live as a responsible being among other beings in this sacred world here and now, which is all we have, and all we need to found our hope upon. 
Depression can be a signal to reexamine assumptions and change strategies—a slowing down to reorient. If we are to deal effectively with problems, we have to see them realistically. And we have to define our purpose... The best antidepressants are expression and action—engagement in the struggle. That way depression is not an end, but a meaningful beginning. 
While I breathe, I hope. 
Never despair but if you do, work on in despair. 
Darkness is only driven out with light, not more darkness.

I was so scared to give up depression, fearing that somehow the worst part of me was actually all of me.

A depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every page I have turned in life.
The five stages – denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance – are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief.

This is my depressed stance. When you’re depressed, it makes a lot of difference how you stand. The worst thing you can do is straighten up and hold your head high because then you’ll start to feel better. If you’re going to get any joy out of being depressed, you’ve got to stand like this.

Crying is one of the highest devotional songs. One who knows crying, knows spiritual practice. If you can cry with a pure heart, nothing else compares to such a prayer. Crying includes all the principles of Yoga.
I didn’t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn’t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I’d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.

Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.
Being sad and being depressed are two different things. Also, people going through depression don’t look so, while someone sad will look sad. The most common reaction is, ‘How can you be depressed? You have everything going for you. You are the supposed number one heroine and have a plush home, car, movies… What else do you want?
Recovering from the suicide of a loved one, you need all the help you can get, so I very much recommend a meditation program. The whole picture of how to recover from this has to do with body, mind, and spirit. That’s applicable to any kind of depression.
The deepest fear we have, ‘the fear beneath all fears,’ is the fear of not measuring up, the fear of judgment. It’s this fear that creates the stress and depression of everyday life.
There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, saying, ‘There now, hang on, you’ll get over it.’ Sadness is more or less like a head cold – with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer.
I’ve got a bad case of the 3:00 am guilts – you know, when you lie in bed awake and replay all those things you didn’t do right? Because, as we all know, nothing solves insomnia like a nice warm glass of regret, depression and self-loathing.
It’s my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic if they can see you hurting, and for the millionth time in my life I wish for measles or smallpox or some other easily understood disease just to make it easier on me and also on them.
I don’t want to see anyone. I lie in the bedroom with the curtains drawn and nothingness washing over me like a sluggish wave. Whatever is happening to me is my own fault. I have done something wrong, something so huge I can’t even see it, something that’s drowning me. I am inadequate and stupid, without worth. I might as well be dead.
A big part of depression is feeling really lonely, even if you’re in a room full of a million people.
Depression, for me, has been a couple of different things – but the first time I felt it, I felt helpless, hopeless, and things I had never felt before. I lost myself and my will to live.
Depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is.
Maybe we all have darkness inside of us and some of us are better at dealing with it than others.

In wine there is wisdom, in beer there is freedom, in water there is bacteria.

All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.
Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.
All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

That which the dream shows is the shadow of such wisdom as exists in man, even if during his waking state he may know nothing about it.... We do not know it because we are fooling away our time with outward and perishing things, and are asleep in regard to that which is real within ourself.
Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality; man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true.
When you stop having dreams and ideals -- well, you might as well stop altogether.
Dreams are renewable. No matter what our age or condition, there are still untapped possibilities within us and new beauty waiting to be born.
Be careful what you water your dreams with. Water them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream. Water them with optimism and solutions and you will cultivate success. Always be on the lookout for ways to turn a problem into an opportunity for success. Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream.
You’ve got to follow your passion. You’ve got to figure out what it is you love, who you really are. And have the courage to do that. I believe that the only courage anybody ever needs is the courage to follow your own dreams.
Often we don’t even realize who we’re meant to be because we’re so busy trying to live out someone else's ideas. But other people and their opinions hold no power in defining our destiny.

The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn, the bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.
Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.
Dreams can become a reality when we possess a vision that is characterized by the willingness to work hard, a desire for excellence, and a belief in our right and our responsiblity to be equal members of society.
No one should negotiate their dreams. Dreams must be free to fly high. No government, no legislature, has a right to limit your dreams. You should never agree to surrender your dreams.
Our dreams must be stronger than our memories. We must be pulled by our dreams, rater than pushed by our memories.
We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort.

Dreams must be heeded and accepted. For a great many of them come true.
The interpretation of dreams is a great art.
What dreams we have and how they fly. Like rosy clouds across the sky; Of wealth, of fame, of sure success, Of love that comes to cheer and bless; And how they wither, how they fade, The waning wealth, the jilting jade -The fame that for a moment gleams,Then flies forever, -dreams, ah -dreams!
Dreams become reality when we put our minds to it.
The more closely you get in touch with your dreams, the more able you are to make them real. The more vividly you consider how you want your world to be, the more real and effective tools you will have for making it so.
Dreams are a scientific fact.
The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.

We are all of us dreamers of dreams, on visions our childhood is fed.

Night poured over the desert. It came suddenly, in purple.

I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...

There is no lack of water here unless you try to establish a city where no city should be.

Its caravans, those strange rambling feasts and cultures, left nothing behind, not an ember. All of us, even those with European homes and children in the distance, wished to remove the clothing of our countries. It was a place of faith. We disappeared into landscape.

A third of the land on our planet is desert. These great scars on the face of the Earth
Cry for the desert / I will tremble and receive His pain / Die for the desert / I will pour my life on this terrain.
The sun was rising / The day was saddled up to go / The desert is a lonely night for disappear
The rain in flowers through the desert sky / Is wiser then you and me / The birds now go east / But still miss a sleep / And the desert raven he has palm trees
If the earth is up above us stars are down below / If there are daisies in the desert roses in the snow
Cactus plants are bloomin', sagebrush every where / Granite spires are standin' all around / I tell you folks it's Heaven, to be ridin' down the trail / When the desert sun goes down
Somewhere north of heaven / Where eagles fear to fly / Where the sun burns hot as the devil's gate / The desert meets the sky
Suffers who suffer all / Can swim upon the desert / Where avarice have ravaged all
It was a dry wind / And it swept across the desert / And it curled into the circle of birth / And the dead sand
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground / From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road / Out of your Dust Bowl and westward we rolled / And your deserts were hot and your mountain was cold
Stars are brighter / In the desert sky / No need to wonder or justify
Heavenly places we seek to find / Here lies a desert / With spirits running dry
The desert air is hot and dry / Two lanes weaving earth and sky / The stars are all that's keeping time till morning
And the white sand begins / Among the rocks. / The wheeling eagles mocked me high there from the skies, / The red blast of the desert wind
The coolness of the evening breeze, / caresses her high-boned cheeks, / dreamy, almond eyes stare toward the / parched mountains of the desert, / beyond any highway signs and / sun-baked roads.
The farmer works, the bull cries loud, / For all they want is a rain yielding cloud. / The desert's shrub though green in color, / Will attract scores of rain yet to come, / For mere fulfillment of the empty drum.
The brown crusty surface of the desert soil, / Can always be ploughed by hard turmoil.
Only a greater stillness in the air, / Save for hot sighs of desert-heated breath, / Only the stars, ceasing their sleepless stare, / Only the east, rose-flushing, fresh from death.
The desert foxes hide in holes, / The jackal seeks his lair; / The sombre rocks, like reddening coals, / Glow lurid in the glare.
Deserts occur along western coasts because their climates are influenced by nearly eastern boundary currents.
Sandy deserts certainly exist, but most deserts are not vast oceans of sand. They are rocky, with a hard surface covered with stones and gravel and outcrops of bare rock.
Deserts are windy places and over thousands of years the wind blows away all the dust and sand.
In some deserts there are rocks carved by the wind into fantastic shapes. The sand must go somewhere, of course. It piles up to form dunes, but the dunes are constantly shifting as the restless wind ceaselessly rearranges the landscape.
Nor are all deserts hot. Even those that are hot by day are often cold at night, but some deserts are cold for most of the time.
There are also deserts lying beside coasts, where fog is common but rain is extremely rare.
Other deserts are icy wilderness, no less windy and arid--despite the snow and ice that covers the ground and the screaming blizzards of blown snow that reduce the world to a uniform whiteness.
Deserts, both hot and cold, are also home to people who have found ways to thrive in them.
Deserts are barren, inhospitable places. The very word conjures an image of featureless and dunes stretching beautiful but terrible for as far as the eye can see.
We affect the desert and desert affects us. Deserts are an integral part of the story of humanity and thus are the object of fascination for many of us.
Until now there has been no single source that addresses all the complex factors that constitute desert ecosystem.
Among the major challenges facing desert organisms are also water, salt balance, light , and temperature.
A desert, which might be considered the antithesis of the sea, actually poses similar challenges to the evolution of life.
Human and deserts have been inextricably linked across the ages, and it is important that we understand these marvelous areas, for they are a major component in the world.
Deserts have been important throughout human history. The cradle of civilization is located in a dryland situated near the confluence of two great rivers.
Deserts have been the scene for the development of great religious (Religion in Deserts) and theaters for great wars.
Deserts make a major contribution to the remarkable nature of our planet and provide a home for innumerable species that are unknown outside the boundaries of arid lands.
Far from being wastelands, deserts are habitats that are filled with unique forms of life.
One popular view of a desert is that of a wasteland containing mainly snakes and scorpions and a few sparse plants, but the world's deserts are rich in both animals and plants.
Deserts and semideserts may support vast fields of dunes, extensive gallery forests, space scrublands, and salt lakes.
Many desert species bloom in the late winter; others flower in spring or fall.
Deserts embrace a huge variety of conditions. There are hot deserts and cold deserts, sandy deserts and rocky deserts, foggy deserts and sunny deserts, barren deserts and lush, verdant parts of deserts.
Deserts are found at high altitudes and below sea level, on coastlines and deep inside continental interiors. They are places of romance, and of hardship, of deep spirituality and dazzling natural beauty.
Deserts include vast areas of stark wilderness and large, densely populated cities with every modern amenity.
People has been inextricably linked with deserts since time immemorial. Crucial early developments in agriculture and the rise of the city took place in the deserts of the Middle East, the 'cradle of civilization'.
The world's deserts have been perceived as places of magnificence and mystery, silence and contemplation, inspiring novelists, poets, artists, and film-makers, and acting as the birth place for three of the world's great religions.
The irregular dynamics of desert life can make these environments seem marginal in many respects.
Deserts are among the regions most vulnerable to climate change, but their great global extent also means that an understanding of how deserts respond to change has implications for the planet as a whole and thus for every one of us.
An artist's approach to deserts may be different from the stance taken by a scientist although, broadly, the two usually overlap geographically. It may, or may not, be surprising to learn that no universally accepted definition of the term 'desert' exists.
Deserts are thirsty places. They get less than 10 inches (25 centimetres) of rain a year. Still, these dry places are full of amazing animals.
Deserts have long captured our imaginations with their inaccessible and inhospitable nature. Even a casual visit to the desert will expose an individual to feelings of vastness, solitude, and one's own frailty.
Your are struck by the awesome beauty of the desert landscape even as you view it in the relentless glare of the midday sun. It is at once a kaleidoscope of images, a land of contrasts and paradoxes.
The desert landscape appears as if it has been stripped to its bare essentials with no room for frivolous decor.
A desert is a particularly arid region of the planet where the vegetation cover is limited or almost absent and the fauna is scarce.
What you come to see on the surface is not what you come to know. Emptiness in the desert is the fullness of space, a fullness of space that eliminates time. The desert is time, exposed time, geologic time. One needs time in the desert to see.
Deserts are very dry places, but plants can still grow there. Desert plants collect and use water in special ways.

Death never takes a wise man by surprise; he is always ready to go. 
Six feet of earth makes us all equal. 
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

To himself everyone is immortal; he may know that he is going to die, but he can never know that he is dead. 
The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. 
A man does not die of love or his liver or even of old age; he dies of being a man.

Friendship is like a glass ornament, once it is broken it can rarely be put back together exactly the same way.
Tis the privilege of friendship to talk nonsense, and to have her nonsense respected.
One measure of friendship consists not in the number of things friends can discuss, but in the number of things they need no longer mention.
What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
A friend knows the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.
Friends are those rare people who ask how we are and then wait to hear the answer.
There is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person, however dear and beloved, but an expansion, an interpretation, of one’s self, the very meaning of one’s soul.
Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart.
True friends don’t judge each other, they judge other people together.
I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen.
The best time to make friends is before you need them.
The real test of friendship is can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple?
A friend can tell you things you don’t want to tell yourself.
It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.
Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.
Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance; they make the latitudes and longitudes.
True friendship can afford true knowledge. It does not depend on darkness and ignorance.
There’s not a word yet for old friends who’ve just met.
In prosperity our friends know us; in adversity we know our friends.
In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter and sharing of pleasure. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.
A single rose can be my garden… a single friend, my world.
A good friend is a connection to life a tie to the past, a road to the future, the key to sanity in a totally insane world.
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.
Friendship improves happiness, and abates misery, by doubling our joys, and dividing our grief.
In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
Friends are the siblings God never gave us.
Never forget that a true friend is someone who understands your past, believes in your future, and accepts you just the way you are.
Ultimately the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or in friendship, is conversation.
Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend’s success.
There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first; when you learn to live for others, they will live for you.
A friendship that can end never really began.
I value the friend who for me finds time on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar.
A friend is a gift you give yourself.
If you have two friends in your lifetime, you’re lucky. If you have one good friend, you’re more than lucky.
The great thing about new friends is that they bring new energy to your soul.
Life is partly what we make it, and partly what it is made by the friends we choose.
Don’t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.
Sweet is the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart.
A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.
If you live to be 100, I hope I live to be 100 minus 1 day, so I never have to live without you.
It is not flesh and blood but the heart which makes us fathers and sons.
An ounce of blood is worth more than a pound of friendship.
We all grow up with the weight of history on us. Our ancestors dwell in the attics of our brains as they do in the spiraling chains of knowledge hidden in every cell of our bodies.
You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.
A father's a treasure; a brother's a comfort; a friend is both. 
A brother may not be a friend, but a friend will always be a brother. 
Families are the compass that guides us. They are the inspiration to reach great heights, and our comfort when we occasionally falter.
Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we're related for better or for worse and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.
Home is where you are loved the most and act the worst.
Be it ever so humble there's no place like home. 
Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible -- the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family.
Children are a poor man's riches. 
Children have more need of models than critics.
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories.
Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.
One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters.

Having children makes you no more a parent than having a piano makes you a pianist.
The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
While we try to teach our children all about life, our children teach us what life is all about.
All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.
It is a wise father that knows his own child.
Bringing up a family should be an adventure, not an anxious discipline in which everybody is constantly graded for performance.
Parents are like God because you wanna know they're out there, and you want them to think well of you, but you really only call when you need something.
Parents were the only ones obligated to love you; from the rest of the world you had to earn it.
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof.
The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home. 
A mother is not a person to lean on, but a person to make leaning unnecessary.
The best inheritance a parent can give to his children is a few minutes of their time each day.
The children despise their parents until the age of when they suddenly become just like them - thus preserving the system.
This is part of what a family is about, not just love. It's knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame. Not work.
Home is people. Not a place. If you go back there after the people are gone, then all you can see is what is not there any more.
A daughter without her mother is a woman broken. It is a loss that turns to arthritis and settles deep into her bones.
The informality of family life is a blessed condition that allows us to become our best while looking our worst.
We cannot destroy kindred: our chains stretch a little sometimes, but they never break.
This was the trouble with families. Like invidious doctors, they knew just where it hurt.
Blood is thicker than water. 
A house divided cannot stand. 
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
A crab walks, so walks his children. 
What children say, they have heard at home.
You can do anything with children if only you play with them.
To put the world right in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right.
Like father, like son. 
Home is where the heart is. 
Give an extra piece of cake to a stepchild.
Charity begins at home. 
When you educate a man you educate an individual. When you educate a woman you educate a whole family.

Family: A social unit where the father is concerned with parking space, the children with outer space, and the mother with closet space.
Family quarrels are bitter things. They don’t go according to any rules. They’re not like aches or wounds, they’re more like splits in the skin that won’t heal because there’s not enough material.
You can kiss your family and friends good-bye and put miles between you, but at the same time you carry them with you in your heart, your mind, your stomach, because you do not just live in a world but a world lives in you.
In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together, and the music that brings harmony.

The family is the test of freedom; because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself.
When trouble comes, it’s your family that supports you.
So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modelled upon it.

Being a family means you are a part of something very wonderful. It means you will love and be loved for the rest of your life.
In truth a family is what you make it. It is made strong, not by number of heads counted at the dinner table, but by the rituals you help family members create, by the memories you share, by the commitment of time, caring, and love you show to one another, and by the hopes for the future you have as individuals and as a unit.

It didn’t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it.
The family is the first essential cell of human society.
I don't think quantity time is as special as quality time with your family.
Family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice. It can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice.
One’s family is the most important thing in life. I look at it this way: One of these days I’ll be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me. And the only people who’ll be with me will be my family.
Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.
You must remember, family is often born of blood, but it doesn't depend on blood. Nor is it exclusive friendship. Family members can be your best friends, you know. And best friends, whether or not they are related to you, can be your family.
Treat your family like friends and your friends like family.
Family isn’t always blood. It’s the people in your life who want you in theirs; the ones who accept you for who you are. The ones that would do anything to see your smile and who love you no matter what.
Families are like branches on a tree. We grow in different directions, yet our roots remain as one.

Men can starve from a lack of self-realization as much as they can from a lack of bread.
People often say that this or that person has not yet found himself. But the self is not something one finds, it is something one creates.
Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.
Know yourself. Don't accept your dog's admiration as conclusive evidence that you are wonderful.
Know thyself? If I knew myself, I'd run away.
The only journey is the journey within.
Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.
One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life, and there is nothing better.
 I think that somehow, we learn who we really are and then live with that decision.
Should we say the self, once perceived, becomes the soul? 
Resolve to be thyself: and know, that he who finds himself, loses his misery.
To find yourself, think for yourself. 
If a man happens to find himself, he has a mansion which he can inhabit with dignity all the days of his life.
In the end you don't so much find yourself as you find someone who knows who you are. 
Don't spend all of your time trying to FIND yourself. Spend your time CREATING yourself into a person that you'll be proud of.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
Know, first, who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.
Don't worry about finding your soul mate. Find yourself.
Whatever it takes to find the real you, don't be daunted if the rest of the world looks on in shock.
When you fight yourself to discover the real you, there is only one winner.
Someday, somewhere – anywhere, unfailingly, you'll find yourself, and that, and only that, can be the happiest or bitterest hour of your life.
I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.
Each man's life represents a road toward himself.
Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.
First find the man in yourself if you will inspire manliness in others.
Lose yourself wholly; and the more you lose, the more you will find.
You've got to know yourself so you can at last be yourself.
Be who you are, and find yourself so you can be your own person and enjoy life with no regret.
Your real self may be hiding somewhere, look for it within, when you find yourself, you can freely be what you want to be. 
Find yourself first-like yourself first-love yourself FIRST & friendship & love will naturally find YOU.
Finding oneself and one's path is like waking up on a foggy day. Be patient, and presently the fog will clear and that which has always been there can be seen. The path is already there to follow.
Find the love you seek, by first finding the love within yourself. Learn to rest in that place within you that is your true home.
You can always find the sun within yourself if you will only search.
If you're being ignored, that's a good time to concentrate on finding yourself and creating your own mystery.
It's a life's journey of finding ourselves, finding our power, and living for yourself, not for everyone else.
You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say, 'I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself.
You've got to find yourself first. Everything else'll follow.
You never find yourself until you face the truth.
Sometimes when you lose your way, you find YOURSELF.
The only way to find yourself is when you start being true to everyone around you.
We lose ourselves in things we love. We find ourselves there, too.
All the wonders you seek are within yourself.
Sometimes we must lose ourselves to find ourselves.
Know thyself means this, that you get acquainted with what you know, and what you can do.
It's not about finding a home so much as finding yourself.
Go find yourself first So you can also find me.
Find out who you are and do it on purpose.
Committing yourself is a way of finding out who you are. A man finds his identity by identifying.
One does not 'find oneself' by pursuing one's self, but on the contrary by pursuing something else and learning through discipline or routine... who one is and wants to be.
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
Your imagination is your preview of life’s coming attractions.
Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.
I think you travel to search and you come back home to find yourself there.
Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.
Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.
Our greatest fear in life shouldn’t be of failure, but of succeeding at things that don’t really matter.
You learn to speak by speaking, to study by studying, to run by running, to work by working; and just so you learn to love… by loving.
Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time.
Sometimes you have to kind of die inside in order to rise from your own ashes and believe in yourself and love yourself to become a new person.
Without leaps of imagination or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.
Never look back unless you are planning to go that way.
Whether you think you can or you think you can’t… You’re right.
One’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.
When we find a purpose that is bigger than ourselves, we become more powerful in our ability to create.
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.
If you don’t design your own life plan, chances are you’ll fall into someone else’s plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.
Learn how to separate the majors and the minors. A lot of people don’t do well simply because they major in minor things.
I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
Knowledge comes by taking things apart: analysis. But wisdom comes by putting things together.
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment and I told them they didn’t understand life.
Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out.
Follow your bliss and don’t be afraid, and doors will open where you didn’t know they were going to be.
We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
A year from now you will wish you had started today.
When you’re committed to something you accept no excuses only results!
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.
Life is not about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Not all dreamers are winners, but all winners are dreamers. Your dream is the key to your future.
Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.
Don’t count the days, make the days count.
The man who has no imagination has no wings.
The starting point of all achievement is desire.
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it… The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.
When I discover who I am, I’ll be free.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
Don’t let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning.
Don't watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.
The very nature of creativity is coming up with things that have never been tried before.
You combine hard work, creativity, and self-determination things start to happen.
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
Live out of your imagination, not your history.
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
Remember to muster up your courage and silence your fear.
Doubt kills more Dreams than failure ever will.
I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.
The pessimists are usually right, but it’s the optimists that change the world.
I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.
If you don’t build your dream, someone else will hire you to build theirs.
The one who says it’s not possible should move out of the way of those doing it.
No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist.
Nothing in the world is more common than unsuccessful people with talent.
All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
I will tell you the secret of getting rich on Wall Street. You try to be greedy when others are fearful and you try to be very fearful when others are greedy.
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing–that’s why we recommend it daily.

Every generation revolts against its fathers and makes friends with its grandfathers.

The destiny of future generations depends on our action today
A generation is not defined by the options it has but by the choices it makes.
We are the generation that came of age in an ageless society.
Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.

We are the new generation that will be raised up and will remain on high
Each generation has a backlash against the generation before.
The young generation has a different curiosity that is more visual.
Each generation should be made to bear the burden of its own wars, instead of carrying them on, at the expense of other generations.
Every generation is more influenced by technology, which is always changing faster.
The generations of men run on in the tide of time, but leave their destined lineaments permanent for ever and ever.
The knowledge of one generation is the ignorance of the next.
Each generation takes the earth as trustees. We ought to bequeath to posterity as many forests and orchards as we have exhausted and consumed.
Generational oppression begins when what is meant to be transferred to one offspring has been taken over by reason of oppression.
Each generation has been an education for us in different ways. The first child with bloody nose was rushed to the emergency room. The fifth child with bloody nose was told to go to the yard immediately and stop bleeding on the carpet.
Each generation must recreate liberty for its own times.
We can help the next generation, with the stories we write today.
Every generation of converts threshes over the same old straw.

We are the first generation of human beings to have substantial insights into the origin of our cosmos and of human life in it.
What one generation sees as a luxury, the next sees as a necessity.
The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.
Our generation must be inspired to search for that maturity which will manifest itself in the qualities of tenacity, dependability, co-operativeness and the inner drive to work and sacrifice for a nobler future of mankind.
We are raising a generation that has a woefully small stock of ideas and interests and emotions. It must be amused at all costs but it has little skill in amusing itself. It pays some of its members to do what the majority can no longer do for themselves. It is this inner poverty that makes for the worst kind of boredom.
The next generation of businessmen will be articulate, knowing what they believe and entering joyously into the battle of ideas, or there will be no business as we have known it heretofore.
The character of a generation is moulded by personal character.
Each generation must win democracy for itself. Many young persons wish they might have lived in the historic and courageous time of George Washington, for example, when there were victories to be made and real history written. On the contrary, there are just as big problems today, and every opportunity for development.
Occasionally we all inherit, or are given, or get something or some things that are too good to use for a variety of seemingly sound but really quite silly reasons—they’re heirlooms or too rare or too expensive or too fragile or too pretty. The result is heirloom linen handed down from generation to generation that falls apart when some benighted heiress decides to air it.
While I'm glad that past generations saved some things we now enjoy, we are enjoying them by using them instead of carefully storing them for our kids—in turn to store. Unused beautiful things are a waste.
I have to study politics and war so that my sons can study mathematics, commerce and agriculture, so their sons can study poetry, painting and music.
Tradition means handing on all that is of value to the next generation.
Generations are as the days of toilsome mankind.... What the father has made, the son can make and enjoy but has also work of his own appointed him. Thus all things wax and roll onwards; arts, establishments, opinions; nothing is ever completed, but ever completing.
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever.
Most oldsters are fascinated by the Future, while the young love to look back to earlier days, especially their own.
To young people everything looks permanent, established—and in their eyes everything should be, needs to be changed. To older people everything seems to change, and in their view almost nothing should.
Older generations are living proof that younger generations can survive their lunacy.
We may consider each generation as a separate nation, with a right, by the will of the majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another country.
We have to hate our immediate predecessors to get free of their authority.
Few can be induced to labor exclusively for posterity. Posterity has done nothing for us.
Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the ages and generations which preceded it. The vanity of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies.
Every generation, no matter how paltry its character, thinks itself much wiser than the one immediately preceding it, let alone those that are more remote.
The man who sees two or three generations is like one who sits in the conjurer’s booth at a fair, and sees the same
tricks two or three times. They are meant to be seen only once.
Tradition is not a fetish to he prayed to— but a useful record of experiences. Time should bring improvement—but not all old things are worthless. We are served by both the moderns and the ancients. The balanced man is he who clings to the best in the old—and appropriates the desirable in the new.
I have had enough experience in all my years, and have read enough of the past, to know that advice to grandchildren is usually wasted. If the second and third generations could profit by the experience of the first generation, we would not be having some of the troubles we have today.
Every one expects to go further than his father went; every one expects to be better than he was born and every generation has one big impulse in its heart—to exceed all the other generations of the past in all the things that make life worth living.
A generation which ignores history has no past—and no future.
A generation of men is like a generation of leaves: the wind scatters some leaves upon the ground, while others the burgeoning wood brings forth — and the season of spring comes on. So of men one generation springs forth and another ceases.

I don't feel at home in this generation / The ones without a need they ain't got a reason / I've been feeling alone in this generation
We want to know the face of freedom / We want to make a place where we can learn to love / Build a world that we can be proud of / This is my generation
Pardon me for living, but this is my world too / I can't help if what's cool to us might be strange to you / Pardon me for breathing, borrow some of your air / The trouble with your generation is you don't take time to care
Bold generation, we wanna change the world / The only thing that's in our way is you / Your old-fashioned music, your old ideas
/ We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

Through the hard times, people try and kick you when you're down / Through these hard times, don't it always seem like there's never / anyone around to help you when you're strung out?
Through these hard times people see what it's like for the poor / Through these hard times people really find out what it's like to be ignored

Many years you have lingered around my cabin door / Oh hard times come again no more 
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest / Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress 
Every day held a new surprise / I watched the hunger burning in my sister's eyes / The paste-board shack we called home / Would haunt me in my dreams / Cause there's nothing soft about hard times
We never knew anything groovy / A dime meant bread and not a movie
The muscles that controlled my smile were rarely ever used / Cause there's nothing soft about hard times

Hard times / Blue and sad / Don't you cross the line / Run, run make it fun / Freeing up the time
Cause hard times they come and they go / Most of the time they're in the middle of the road / It's the same pain in different ways / Don't your know, Son, when it pours it rains
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears / While we all sup sorrow with the poor / There's a song that will linger forever in our ears / Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sigh of the weary / Hard times, hard times, come again no more / Many a days you have lingered around my cabin door / Oh, hard times, come again no more

I had a woman / Who was always around / But when I lost my money / She put me down
Same old sad eyed news man on my same old TV set/ Talking about our big depression but I ain't worried yet / About hard times, hard times
Fallen on hard times but it feels good to know / that milk and honey's just around the bend / Running on bad lines we'd better run as we go / Tear up, tear up the overdraft again.
Looking for sunshine oh but it's black and it's cold / Yet, you say that milk and honey's just round the bend / Giving us a hard time, my friends / handing us the same line again.
Have you ever felt / That your life is a wasting / Happiness beyond your reach / Sweet love has gone astray / Suddenly it's bitter / Hard times
When you're all alone / Nothing seems to matter / Sadness always fills the air / Hurts so deep inside / You just have to cry out / Wow, hard times
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.
I have a hard time with left and right. / And I have a hard time with right and wrong!

By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you’ll become happy; if you get a bad one, you’ll become a philosopher.
The great marriages are partnerships. It can’t be a great marriage without being a partnership.
In terms of my marriage, you know, falling in love with my husband was by far the best thing that’s ever happened to me.
A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person.
A great marriage is not when the ‘perfect couple’ comes together. It is when an imperfect couple learns to enjoy their differences.
A good marriage is one which allows for change and growth in the individuals and in the way they express their love.
Marriage is not about age; it’s about finding the right person.
I have a best friend as a husband, and he is my number one supporter. He’s a family man, and he’s always giving back to God. That is what makes him a beautiful man.

So it’s not gonna be easy. It’s going to be really hard; we’re gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me… everyday.

The secret to a happy marriage is if you can be at peace with someone within four walls, if you are content because the one you love is near to you, either upstairs or downstairs, or in the same room, and you feel that warmth that you don’t find very often, then that is what love is all about.
The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church or synagogue. It’s a choice you make – not just on your wedding day, but over and over again – and that choice is reflected in the way you treat your husband or wife. 
Through devotion, your family cares become more peaceful, mutual love between husband and wife becomes more sincere, the service we owe to the prince more faithful, and our work, no matter what it is, becomes more pleasant and agreeable.

Husband and wife, if you like; vows of love, exchanged before God. You two were married long ago, and you will be married forevermore.
I'll just have to make you my wife. A husband and wife must share everything. 
If ever two were one, then surely we. / If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee. / If ever wife was happy in a man, / Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
And I really didn't think as to whether or not she thought about me; as for me she was the most immortally passionate girl on this unbridled Universe; whose every unconquerable heartbeat drew me more closer and closer to her divinely form; and without even me and her realizing the slightest; made us forever and ever and ever as 'Husband & Wife'.
We'll be together, / Husband and wife, / Now and forever, / The rest of our lives.
A home and a family / A husband, a wife / And to life each day is a way of life
I promise to love you and do my best for you / I need you to help me to find my strength / Walk with me all through my life / My lover my husband my wife / Share this journey with me / Write this story with me
I can see you / On your wedding day / With the one you love / To share the way / A life ahead of you / Youth left behind / Go out and make yourself / Some memories
You may find comfort in your husband or your wife / When your mother is gone.
You shall not commit adultery. / Do be pure in heart and mind. / Love your husband or wife, keep your heart clean. 
Bless this day / Pinnacle of life / Husband joined to wife / The heart leaps up to behold / This golden day
We stood at the altar, repeating our vows for life / For better or worse, forever a husband and wife / Love's not always easy and dreams don't all come true / Why'd you lose your faith in me, I never gave up on you
A man and a woman are meant for each other / Are meant for each other as husband and wife / From this moment forward, I promise to love thee/ I promise to love thee the rest of my life
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife / Us both dressed alike in the purest white / Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around / ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows
Marriage is also, ideally, a relationship in which people feel safe being themselves, it might seem to make sense to train couples to practice this sort of unconditional understanding.
A married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.
God created you and your husband to be different so you would complement and bring health to each other should give you an incentive to meet his need for praise and admiration.
The secret is not being the 'right' husband or wife--it's being the right husband or wife, at the right time, in your particular marriage.
As our marriage and our family grew, my relationship with my wife grew as well.
Many women focus so much on trying to get their husband to change that they fail to see the areas in which they need to evolve.
Strong marriages are built on the loving things people in the present, not on the memories of the things they did in the past.
Focus on continually changing and growing in order to make sure you are someone your spouse would still choose today.
Successful couples don't escape difficult times; they change and adapt, forging a stronger relationship.
Being in love isn't enough. Staying in love happens when you and your spouse work out how to embrace change, solve problems, and treat each other when the going gets tough.
Incorporating an effective system of checks and balances is the best way for couples to get a clear sense of their progress.
Love and the ability to change go hand and hand in making a marriage that nourishes and inspires not only the couple, but all who know them.
No part of her life should be outside of her relationship to her husband and outside of subordination to him.
This subordination of wife to husband has a practical aspect in that it creates a greater effectiveness in their working together as one.
Married couple should have an understanding of their spouse suffering from inherent sin, imperfection, and human weakness, so as to make allowances for falling short. Just how bad is it?
Every husband must love his wife as himself and every wife must respect her husband.
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives.
There's no such thing as a 'perfect marriage' or a 'perfect spouse'. Come on, get real! Marriage is a flawed institution. if you but into that theory.
I believe what a husband needs from wife is not a woman who just keeps trying harder to figure out marriage. Instead, a husband needs a woman who loves God, abides Christ, and follows Him all the days of her life.
The key to a great marriage is the quality of the habits you share together. Healthy, positive habits create and extraordinarily happy marriage.
Chains do not hold a marriage together. It is threads, hundreds of tiny threads which sew people together through the years.
Happy marriages begin when we marry the ones we love, and they blossom when we love the ones we marry.
It is not lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.
What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.

There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye, keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.
After marriage, husband and wife become two sides of a coin; they just can't face each other, but still they stay together.
I had some words with my wife, and she had some paragraphs with me.
My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.
A good wife always forgives her husband when she's wrong.
If husband and wife wake up with a commitment to worship and serve, they will be delighted in their marriage.
Too many husbands and wives enter into marriage with the idea that their spouse exists for one purpose: to make them happy.
Marriage is not a reform school..Instead of you reforming (your spouse), (he or she) will instead influenced you.
When a husband and wife are concerned only about their own individual desires, the stage is set for conflict.
The perfect marriage is a uniting of three persons--a man and a woman and God. That is what makes marriage holy.

Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or not.
Integrity is telling myself the truth. And honesty is telling the truth to other people. 
A person is not given integrity. It results from the relentless pursuit of honesty at all times.
Nothing more completely baffles one who is full of tricks and duplicity than straight forward and simple integrity in another.
Integrity is not something that you should have to think about...nor consider doing...but something in the heart that is already done.
If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.
You have the right to remain silent, but you can never repeat, never lie or shade the truth.
You are already of consequence in the world if you are known as a man of strict integrity.
Keep true, never be ashamed of doing right, decide on what you think is right and stick to it.
Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular way.
Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.

We should often feel ashamed of our best actions if the world could see all the motives which produced them.
The true perfection of man lies not in what man has, but in what man is.
Integrity is so perishable in the summer months of success.
Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.

A life lived with integrity even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come.
Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will.
Integrity is the first step to true greatness.
In great matters men show themselves as they wish to be seen; in small matters, as they are.
There is always room for those who can be relied upon to deliver the goods when they say they will.
There is no better test of a man's integrity than his behavior when he is wrong.
People who fight fire with fire end up with only the ashes of their own integrity.
There can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do.
Courage combined with integrity is the foundation of character.
That you may retain your self-respect, it is better to displease the people by doing what you know is right, than to temporarily please them by doing what you know is wrong.
It takes less time to do a thing right than to explain why you did it wrong.
Like integrity, love of life was not a subject to be studied, it was a contagion to be caught. And you had to catch it from someone who had it.
Truthfulness is the main element of character.
Integrity is what we do, what we say, and what we say we do.
If you don't have integrity, you have nothing. You can't buy it.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.
Integrity has no need of rules.
The only correct actions are those that demand no explanation and no apology.
Never "for the sake of peace and quiet" deny your own experience or convictions.
Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. The greatest problem with communication is we don’t listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we don’t listen with the intent to reply. We listen for what’s behind the words.
Living with integrity means: Not settling for less than what you know you deserve in your relationships. Asking for what you want and need from others. Speaking your truth, even though it might create conflict or tension. Behaving in ways that are in harmony with your personal values. Making choices based on what you believe, and not what others believe.
Don't assume, ask. Be kind. Tell the truth. Don't say anything you can't stand behind fully. Have integrity. Tell people how you feel.
Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching, and doing as you say you would do.
Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.
Integrity is the ability to stand by an idea.
Integrity is doing what is right and truthful, and doing as you say you would do.
Your integrity determines your destiny.

A mode of conduct, a standard of courage, discipline, fortitude and integrity can do a great deal to make a woman beautiful.

Do not give up on your idealism and integrity.
Don’t trade in your integrity for influence.
Character is holding to our integrity when everyone around us is holding on to everything except their integrity and pressing us to do the same.
True integrity holds its ground even when such a stance means that you have let go of everything else that’s sitting on that ground.
A person's behavior reflects nothing but the mirror of an aura he/she brought up in. Never doubt their integrity because of their insecurities.
From the crucible of courage, perseverance, and integrity comes triumph.
We can test the substance of our own integrity and love when we witness what flows from our hearts when someone disagrees.

WHAT do the scales of Justice hold / Poised even in that steady hand? / What is that measure closely scanned? / Is one side weighted down with gold? / Or is she clamorous for her right?
Surely for that she bides too still!
With level brows this Justice stands / And weighs her duties one by one / And if she pleads, or if commands / It is lest these be left undone.
Or slurred through weakness and constraint / This noble Justice was not bred / In hearts defiled with any taint / Of selfish seeking, dark and dead.
It is my strong belief / God's justice will heal
The wounds and griefs / I have suffered from that
Years and years.
Before we lose the word / That bids new worlds to birth, / Needs must we loosen first the sword
Of Justice upon earth / Or else all else is vain / Since life on earth began / And the spent world sinks back again / Hopeless of God and Man.
TWO lawyers to their cause so well adhered / A country justice quite confused appeared / By them the facts were rendered so obscure / With which the truth remained he was not sure.
When you've been denied justice... you are incomplete. It feels that God has abandoned you in a stark place. I asked God... I think we all did... what we should do, and he said do what is right. And I thought if I did, it would make me complete again.

God knows your value; He sees your potential. You may not understand everything you are going through right now. But hold your head up high, knowing that God is in control and he has a great plan and purpose for your life.
That's typically American. Keep out of trouble and tell other people to keep their chins up.
Come on, you know, chin up, chest out, and best foot forward
When you walk through a storm keep your chin up high and don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of the storm is golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark.
Off you pop, then, and keep your chin up.
Eyes bright, chins up, smiles on. I'm talking to you, Katniss.
You keep your chin up Gus Grimly. We're winning this thing. Don't you forget.
Anyway, chin up, love.. there's nothing ever quite so bad but thinking makes it worse
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag, and smile, smile, smile!
But, chin up. There's a medal in it for sure. Nothing like a scrap of ribbon to cheer up a widow
So chin up chum. You're a beautiful, beautiful human being, and the world is your sunshine.
Chin up, Chang. Believe in yourself and others will, too.
Chin up, Max. It's better to be sad than dead.
What, are you crying? You don't cry, all right? You keep your chin up. Come on, keep your chin up. Crying never helped anybody do anything, okay? You have a problem, you face it like a man.
So keep your chin up and look up high. You'll find your troubles will pass you by.
Chin up, chin up / Everybody loves a happy face / Wear it, share it / It'll brighten up the darkest place / Twinkle, sparkle / Let a little sunshine in / You'll be on the right side, looking at the bright side / Up with your chinny-chin-chin.
There's nothing more uncertain than the life of a man like me. You're so young and so beautiful, and you will be for a long time to come. Remember, no matter what happens, I want you to promise you'll keep your chin up. 
I remember hurting her and her hurting me / I remember losing sleep, she was haunting my dreams / It's alright, chin up kid, it'll all be fine / There's not a wound in this world that won't heal with time
Life goes on, the ending's the starting line / Chin up, press on, you will survive / Young love that lasts is hard to find / So chin up, press on, you will survive
When you're going through your rough time / Maybe I could be your lifeline / Keep your head up, when you're down
Keeping your head up to the sky / Keeping your mind to stay alive / Gimme your wings so we can fly, / (fly away, fly away, fly away) / (Keep your head up tonight)
It's summertime, lights fade away / It's wintertime, let's make it summer / Don't look down, keep your head up
It's gonna be alright / Keep your head up to the sky / [Z-Ro] Cause everything's going to be alright
Keep your head up, because there's always tomorrow / Put the Lord first, be strong, you can't go wrong / Love is on the way if you just pray, and hold on
All praises due to the Most High (To the Most High) / To the Most High heed your prayer to the sky / (You gotta keep your head up to the sky)
Sweet dreams are made of this / Who am I to disagree? / I've traveled the world and the seven seas / Everybody's looking for something / Hold your head up / Keep your head up, moving on
Hey, you might not see it with your eyes / But keep your head up to the sky / The sun is coming through / Here's what you gotta do
Rolling / Keep your head up, look to the sky / Rolling / Don't you ever ask yourself why / Rolling / We'll live forever, you and I / Keep on rolling
We'll be there for eternity / I want you there yeah I want you there with me / Keep your head up he's coming some day to / Carry us away to a better place
If you been hurt, keep your head up, you'll find / If you ever been hurt keep your head up
You should never give it up never give it up never give it up / Learn to love yourself / That's why u got to keep it up got to keep it up got to keep it up / Keep your head up high yeah
Don't let it get the best of you, you'll make it out alive / Oh, people like us we've gotta stick together / Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever / Here's to the lost and forgotten / It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom
What do you do when it's too much for you / Chin up, chin up / You know these sticks and these stones cannot break my bones / Chin up, chin up
Encourage one another and you must keep that same encouragement yourself first, to encourage others, second keep your head up and count all joy in the worst of times.
Encourage others today! So often the difference between success and failure is belief.
Weed and feed. Our minds are like a garden; each day you need to weed out the negativity and feed it positivity.
You are more powerful than your circumstances. They don't define you. You do.
The story you tell yourself defines the life you live and the actions you take. It's important to tell yourself a positive story.
Regain your power, every word that leaves your mouth should breathe love.
It is important to observe, question, interpret, and then empower yourself to make the choices with which you can live.
We must also look into our feelings of grief and loss. When we accept that everything is constantly changing, when we accept the inevitability that people and animals die, we can deal with pain in a much better fashion.
Embrace your grief and your sadness felt towards those that have passed and remember them with love.
Replace your grief with love and appreciation. That is truly what any who have departed from our lives would wish for us.
You associate with people who are kind, compassionate, and joyous. You keep good company, and you reflect these qualities yourself.
I choose to be around people who uplift and support me and themselves.
You value yourself, spiritually, mentally, and physically. You are a unique individual with so many talents and gifts. You look in the mirror and exclaim, 'I am worthy!'
I am worthy of all the good in the world has to offer.
As tides of life rise and fall, life is constant, like the waves crashing upon the shore. Persistence is the key in high and low times...
Encourage yourself, speak to yourself, and lift yourself right on up. Encourage yourself that change its here. Encourage yourself to continue to pursue.
Encourage yourself to carry it out, to walk it out, to search it out, shout it out, and praise your way out to the change that's being presented with encouragement.
Every cliche about kids is true; they grow up so quickly, you blink and they're gone, and you have to spend the time with them now. But that's a joy. 
Kids always act up the most before they go to sleep.
The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.
Kids: they dance before they learn there is anything that isn't music.
When kids hit one year old, it's like hanging out with a miniature drunk. You have to hold onto them. They bump into things. They laugh and cry. They urinate. They vomit.
Kids are capable of handling a lot more than you think if you are willing to commit some time.
Raising kids is part joy and part guerilla warfare.
Kids will reach whatever expectation you set for them.
Kids flourish if we get them to school every day.
Even though your kids will consistently do the exact opposite of what you're telling them to do, you have to keep loving them just as much.
Of course if you like your kids, if you love them from the moment they begin, you yourself begin all over again, in them, with them, and so there is something more to the world again.
No kid is unsmart. Every kid's a genius at something. Our job is to find it. And then encourage it.
Kids can gain courage when they're around us. They become more secure if they know they're important enough for us to invest time with them. 
Kids go where there is excitement. They stay where there is love.
All kids are gifted. Some just open their packages earlier than others.
All kids need is a little help, a little hope and somebody who believes in them
Kids spell love T-I-M-E.
You don't always know what your kids will do, but your kids should always know what you will do.
When you have brought up kids, there are memories you store directly in your tear ducts.
Do not ask that your kids live up to your expectations. Let your kids be who they are, and your expectations will be in breathless pursuit. 
My mom used to say it doesn't matter how many kids you have... because one kid'll take up 100% of your time so more kids can't possibly take up more than 100% of your time.
If your kids are giving you a headache, follow the directions on the aspirin bottle, especially the part that says keep away from children. 
While we try to teach our children all about life, our children teach us what life is all about.
We may not be able to prepare the future for our children, but we can at least prepare our children for the future.
Children make you want to start life over.
You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have, for instance.
Children in a family are like flowers in a bouquet: there's always one determined to face in an opposite direction from the way the arranger desires.
Children need love, especially when they do not deserve it. 
Children are a poor man's wealth.
Children are likely to live up to what you believe of them.
Teaching kids to count is fine, but teaching them what counts is best.
Let's face it, there's lots of spoiled kids out there . . . because you can't spank Grandma.
What is a home without children? Quiet.
Children need love, especially when they do not deserve it.
Any kid will run any errand for you if you ask at bedtime.
Children are our most valuable resource.
I continue to believe that if children are given the necessary tools to succeed, they will succeed beyond their wildest dreams!
Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.
Children are the hands by which we take hold of heaven.
Children learn more from what you are, than what you teach.
Children are like sponges; they absorb all your strength and leave you limp... but give them a squeeze and you get it all back.
Your children teach you so much. It's a real mirror of yourself.
Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.
Children are not things to be moulded, but are people to be unfolded.
...in serving the best interests of children, we serve the best interests of all humanity.
Children are a wonderful gift . . . They have an extraordinary capacity to see into the heart of things and to expose sham and humbug for what they are.
Children are not the people of tomorrow, but are people of today. They have a right to be taken seriously, and to be treated with tenderness and respect. They should be allowed to grow into whoever they were meant to be. 'The unknown person' inside each of them is our hope for the future.
Even when freshly washed and relieved of all obvious confections, children tend to be sticky.
Your children will see what you're all about by what you live rather than what you say.
Children run wildly, breathlessly... facing the wind...absorbing its speed.
One of the greatest gifts parents can bestow on their children is a happy childhood.
Cooperative children pay attention; they follow rules, and work and paly well with others. With siblings and peers, they share, stake turns, and are good sports whether they win or lose.
Cooperative children enjoy pleasing others without being so-called people pleasers. Following direction seems to come naturally to them most of the time.
As parents, we shape our children's behavior from the day they are born. Their behaviors--desirable and undesirable alike--become established as we reinforce them through our own actions, reactions, and inactions.
Being a character coach means giving your children opportunities for moral action in family life, such as doing chores; playing with, reading to, or caring for a younger brother or sister; helping without being asked; making amends after doing something wrong; and taking part in problem-solving sit-downs where everyone has a voice and responsibility to help to create a happier, more peaceful family.
Parenting remains the hardest job on the planet. It taxes our energies and tests our character. We often see our own faults-pride, impatience, a strong will, a short temper-reflected or magnified in our children. 'God gives us children to teach us humility.'
Our children create their character by choices they make everyday.
Parenting for kindness and respect will be harder with some children than with others, but we can help every child make progress on the road to good character.
Having a daughter as a friend is about as sweet as it can get. 
Share with your daughter about a time when you thought she made a special impact on your family.
As the father of a daughter, I wish I'd read this very funny book sooner, if only to know that it's okay for a grown man to wear a tutu.
My mother was deeply devoted to raising me. To have a happy kid, she figured she needed to be a happy mother, and to be a happy mother, she need to be a happy person. To do that, she had to preserve her authentic self.
If hope and salvation are to come, they can only come from the children, for the children are the makers of men.
Children find everything in nothing, men find nothing in everything.
There are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of a child. There are seven million.
The real magic wand is the child's own mind.
We worry about what a child will become tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today.
Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.
We could never have loved the earth so well if we had no childhood in it.
There is a garden in every childhood, an enchanted place where colors are brighter, the air softer and the morning more fragrant than ever again.
You are worried about seeing him spend his early years in doing nothing. What! Is it nothing to be happy? Nothing to skip, paly and run around all day long? Never in his life will he be so busy again.
Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.
Children make you want to start life over.
You cannot catch a child's spirit by running after it; you must stand still, and, for love, it will soon itself return.
The energy which makes a child hard to manage is the energy which afterwards makes him a manager of life.
Delight and liberty, the simple creed of childhood.
Grandchildren are God's way of compensating us for growing old.
A baby in the house is a well-spring of pleasure, a message of peace and love, a nestling place for innocence on earth, a link between angels and men.
If children are brought into the world by an act of pure reason alone, would the human race continue to exist? 
Happy is the little child, whose mother is tired of talking nonsense to him before he is old enough to know the sense of it.
There is only one pretty child in the world, and every mother has it.
Children are not a burden. The elephant does not find its trunk heavy; nor does mother her baby.
Childhood is the world of miracle and wonders as if a creation of rose, balked in light, out of darkness, utterly new and astonishing. The end of childhood is when things cease to astonish us. When the world seems familiar, when one had got used to existence, one has become an adult.
The bard in the narrow of childhood's suffering is this - it's intense loneliness, it's intense ignorance.
A little world of childhood with his familiar surroundings is a model of the greater world. The more intensively the family has shaped its character upon the child, the more it will tend to feel and see its earlier miniature world again in the bigger world of adult life.
The child's grief throbs against its little heart as heavily as the man's sorrow, and the one finds as much delight in his kite or drum, as the other in striking the springs of enterprise, or soaring on the wings of fame.
The child is surrounded by so much authority, so much school, so much dignity, so much law, that it would have to break down under the weight of all these restraints if it were not saved from such fate by meeting with a friend.
Happiness can improve every child's looks. Happiness can make children eager and interested. Happiness and goof health can go hand in hand. Happiness improves children's relationships with friends and family.
Children are our future we must take care of them with maximum effort.
Regard you soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons.
Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.
Absence is to love as wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small and enkindles the great. 
One who marries for love alone will have bad days but good nights.
Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible - it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could.
I am in love and want to grow pale; I am in love and I want to suffer; I am in love, and I give away my genius in exchange for a kiss.
Love; that self-love a deux.
Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
Love doesn't make the world go 'round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.
Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.
Love: a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain, causes eyes to sparkle, cheeks to glow, blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker.
Love is a canvas furnished by Nature and embroidered by imagination.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor even touched, but just felt in the heart.
At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet.
If I were pressed to say why I loved him, I feel that my only reply could be: 'Because it was he, because it was I'.
Love is a fabric which never fades, no matter how often it is washed in the water of adversity and grief.
In the arithmetic of love, one plus one equals everything, and two minus one equals nothing.
Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses.
Love is like quicksilver in the hand. Leave the fingers open and it stays. Clutch it, and it darts away.
Love is to love someone for who they are, who they were, and who they will be.
To love is nothing. To be loved is something. But to love and be loved, that's everything.
I shall be great and you rich, because we love each other.
Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused.
Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit.
Love is something eternal; the aspect may change, but not the essence.
Love is like an hourglass, with the heart filling up as the brain empties.
Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods.
Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell.
Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.
Love has unbound my limbs and set me shaking, a monster bitter sweet and my unmaking.
Sometimes your nearness takes my breath away and all the things I want to say can find no voice. Then in silence, I can only hope my eyes will speak my heart.
Loving someone and having them love you back is the most precious thing in the world.
Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself.
True love will triumph in the end — which may or may not be a lie, but if it is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie we have.
Life has turned into a beautiful garden ever since you entered into my life. You have changed my life and made me feel so good. I feel so loved and cared for. You are the best thing that happened to me.
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times, in life after life, in age after age forever.
No matter how far you go, I will keep loving you because you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I really love you!
You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own, than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago.
There is no remedy for love but to love more.
The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that.
You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.
There is only one page left to write on. I will fill it with words of only one syllable. I love. I have loved. I will love.
I may search for another thousand years but still may not find someone as sweet and loving as you are.
To live with you is to live. To live without you is to die.
So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
From the day you walked into my life, you're all I think about. You're the reason I breathe. You are the stars in my sky. I wouldn't want this any other way. You're the love of my life.
The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.
To live is like to love - all reason is against it, and all healthy instinct for it.
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.
The best thing you can do is fall in love. My life has been changed by falling in love.
True love is usually the most inconvenient kind.
Being deeply, passionately, and intensely in love is being deeply, passionately, and intensely in life.
To love someone is to see a miracle invisible to others.
Like the flowers that spread fragrance, your love brings romance in my ordinary life.
The most precious possession that ever comes to a man in this world is a woman's heart.
I wanted to tell you that wherever I am, whatever happens, I'll always think of you, and the time we spent together, as my happiest time. I'd do it all over again, if I had the choice. No regrets.
The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love.
I swear I couldn't love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.
I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love you.

In this life, when you deny someone an apology, you will remember it at time you beg forgiveness.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
Short cuts make long delays.
Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate your mistakes for what they are: precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way.
Life is inherently risky. There is only one big risk you should avoid at all costs, and that is the risk of doing nothing.
The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn.
Don't let anyone ever make you feel like you don't deserve what you want.
To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
Mistakes are part of the dues one pays for a full life.
In the long run, we shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. The process never ends until we die. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.
Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.
At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you ll discover will be wonderful. What you ll discover is yourself.
If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you' Not much. 
Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.
Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.
And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
Life is not measured by the number of breaths you take, but by every moment that takes your breath away.
Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure.
The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.
No matter how hard you kick, no matter how high you get, you can't go all the way around.
But one of the big lessons I have learned from my journey is you can't please everyone, so don't try.
You can't wait around for something to become good, it either is, or isn't.
I am not someone who is ashamed of my past. I'm actually really proud. I know I made a lot of mistakes, but they, in turn, were my life lessons.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
You get in life what you have the courage to ask for.
A great attitude becomes a great day which becomes a great month which becomes a great year which becomes a great life.
You can't live your life for other people. You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love.
We are who we choose to be.
Hard truths can be dealt with, triumphed over, but lies will destroy your soul.
Never to lie is to have no lock to your door, you are never wholly alone.
A lie with a purpose is one of the worst kind, and the most profitable.
Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others.
Liars are always most disposed to swear
Sometimes you can learn things from the way a person denies something. The choice of lies can be almost as helpful as the truth.
The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him.
Truth is treason in the empire of lies.
Someone who always has to lie discovers that every one of his lies is true.
I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.
The great mass of people will more easily fall victems to a big lie than to a small one.
They all lie, from the top man down to the bottom. If their lips are moving, a lie is unfolding.
A man would rather have a hundred lies told of him than one truth which he does not wish should be known.
Statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics
It is a problem for me that I am part of a profession that is systematically lying to people.
Never chase a lie. Let it alone, and it will run itself to death. I can work out a good character much faster than anyone can lie me out of it
Never hide things from hardcore thinkers. They get more aggravated, more provoked by confusion than the most painful truths.
The closer to the truth, the better the lie, and the truth itself, when it can be used, is the best lie.
No one believes a liar. Even when she's telling the truth.
The men the American people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth.
Understand that the tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes--never!
Of all the liars in the world, sometimes the worst are your own fears.
It was easier to lie with a gesture than a word.
Lying is done with words and also with silence.
A lie that is half-truth is the darkest of all lies.
A lie would have no sense unless the truth were felt as dangerous.
A lie has no legs, and cannot stand; but it has wings, and can fly far and wide.
A man is never more truthful than when he acknowledges himself a liar.
You may tell the greatest lies and wear a brilliant disguise, but you can't escape the eyes of the one who sees right through you.
The most mischievous liars are those who keep on the verge of truth.
Lots of people go mad in January. Not as many as in May, of course. Nor June. But January is your third most common month for madness.
Make hay in May for you may never know what June is coming with and you may never know what July will present! When you see May, make hay!
Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life! So closely, in their profusion, do they crowd together that lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour as to count the flowers in a meadow in May.
I'm only wishing to go a-fishing;For this the month of May was made.
You are as welcome as the flowers in May.
Tis a month before the month of May, And the spring comes slowly up this way.
In the marvellous month of May when all the buds were bursting, then in my heart did love arise. In the marvellous month of May when all the birds were singing, then did I reveal to her my yearning and longing.
May, more than any other month of the year, wants us to feel most alive.
Another May new buds and flowers shall bring: Ah! why has happiness no second Spring?
Let all thy joys be as the month of May, And all thy days be as a marriage day.
The month of May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and to bring forth fruit.
The world's favorite season is the spring. All things seem possible in May.
I thought that spring must last forevermore;
For I was young and loved, and it was May.
A great difference between May and Day is the M and D! Be a good Managing Director of your life each day in May.
As full of spirit as the month of May, and as gorgeous as the sun in Midsummer.
May: the lilacs are in bloom. Forget yourself.
The month of May is the pleasant time; its face is beautiful; the blackbird sings his full song, the living wood is his holding, the cuckoos are singing and ever singing; there is a welcome before the brightness of the summer.
And after winter folweth grene May.
I curled closer to May, comforted by her warmth.
Beneath the apple blossoms/ I go a wintry way, / For love that smiled in April / Is false to me in May.
May and June. Soft syllables, gentle names for the two best months in the garden year: cool, misty mornings gently burned away with a warming spring sun, followed by breezy afternoons and chilly nights. The discussion of philosophy is over; it's time for work to begin.
When the sun is out and the wind is still,
You're one month on in the middle of May.
The month of May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and to bring forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and flourish in May, in likewise every lusty heart that is in any manner a lover, springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. For it giveth unto all lovers courage, that lusty month of May.
What is so sweet and dear / As a prosperous morn in May, / The confident prime of the day
Sweet May hath come to love us, / Flowers, trees, their blossoms don; / And through the blue heavens above us / The very clouds move on.
I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers: / Of April, May, or June, and July flowers. / I sing of Maypoles, Hock-carts, wassails, wakes, / Of bridegrooms, brides, and of the bridal cakes.
May! Queen of blossoms, / And fulfilling flowers, / With what pretty music / Shall we charm the hours?
Winds of May, that dance on the sea, / Dancing a ring-around in glee / From furrow to furrow, while overhead
The foam flies up to be garlanded.
In the marvelous month of May / when all the birds were singing, / then did I reveal to her / my yearning and longing.
It's May, the lusty month of May / That darling month when everyone throws self-control away.
Memories are like a garden. Regularly tend the pleasant blossoms and remove the invasive weeds.
Memories are the key not to the past, but to the future.
Memories, all those little experiences make up the fabric of our lives and on balance, I wouldn't want to erase any of them, tempting though it may be.
Leftovers in their less visible form are called memories. Stored in the refrigerator of the mind and the cupboard of the heart.
Memories are dangerous things. You turn them over and over, until you know every touch and corner, but still you'll find an edge to cut you.
Be careful who you make memories with. Those things can last a lifetime.
Memories, the one thing that can never be taken away from us. Make lots of them!
Creating memories is a priceless gift. Memories will last a lifetime; things only a short-period of time.
Memories are the treasures that we keep locked deep within the storehouse of our souls, to keep our hearts warm when we are lonely.
Our memories are the only paradise from which we can never be expelled.
Memories are contrary things; if you quit chasing them and turn your back, they often return on their own.
Everybody needs his memories. They keep the wolf of insignificance from the door.
Memories are what warm you up from the inside. But they're also what tear you apart.
I have memories - but only a fool stores his past in the future.
The beautiful thing about memories is that they are yours; whether they are good, bad, or indifferent. They belong to you, and no matter where you are now.
Memories are bullets. Some whiz by and only spook you. Others tear you open and leave you in pieces.
Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what we will.
To have memories of those you have loved and lost is perhaps harder than to have no memories.
In my life I find that memories of the spirit linger and sweeten long after memories of the brain have faded.
Our memories give us voice and bear witness to history, so that others might learn. So they might celebrate our triumphs and be warned of our failures.
If we can't make memories, we can't heal.
The finest memories are those where we have helped someone without expecting anything in return.
When our memories outweigh our dreams, we have grown old.
The happiest memories are of moments that ended when they should have. 
Photos capture our memories in print, but our memories are always with us in our minds. 
Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly. But I don't go along with that. The memories I value most, I don't ever see them fading.
Memories are like antiques, the older they are the more valuable they became.
For some life lasts a short while, but the memories it holds last forever.
The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.
The worst memories stick with us, while the nice ones always seem to slip through our fingers.
Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.
If music be the food of love, play on.
Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.
Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its virtue.
The world's most famous and popular language is music.
Music is the strongest form of magic.
Music in the soul can be heard by the universe.
Music happens to be an art form that transcends language.
One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.
Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.
Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.
Music is what feelings sound like. 
Music is the poetry of the air.
Music is the art which is most nigh to tears and memory. 
Music is well said to be the speech of angels.
Music is very spiritual, it has the power to bring people together.
Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosphy. Music is the electrical soil in which the spirit lives, thinks and invents.
Music does bring people together. It allows us to experience the same emotions. People everywhere are the same in heart and spirit. No matter what language we speak, what color we are, the form of our politics or the expression of our love and our faith, music proves: We are the same.
Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
Music cleanses the understanding; inspires it, and lifts it into a realm which it would not reach if it were left to itself. 
Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.
Without music, life would be a mistake.
Music is what tells us that the human race is greater than we realize.
Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.
Music is the universal language of mankind.
To stop the flow of music would be like the stopping of time itself, incredible and inconceivable.
Music is love in search of a word.
Music takes us out of the actual and whispers to us dim secrets that startle our wonder as to who we are, and for what, whence, and whereto.
Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.
Music is the harmonious voice of creation; an echo of the invisible world.
There's only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.
We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.
Life's burdens are lighter when I laugh at myself.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.
In the end, it's not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away.
The great man is he who does not lose his child's heart.
Dream as if you'll live forever, live as if you'll die today.
Don't be seduced into thinking that that which does not make profit is without value.
The optimist sees the rose and not its thorns; the pessimist stares at the thorns, oblivious to the rose.
Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.
The thinking that got us to where we are is not the thinking that will get us to where we want to be.
Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.
Tell me and I will forget. Show me and I will remember. Involve me and I will understand.
Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Work like you don't need the money, love like you've never been hurt and dance like no one is watching
And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed. 
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind. 
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, â€œI will try again tomorrow.
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
I walk slowly, but I never walk backward.
 Don't be afraid your life will end; be afraid that it will never begin.
A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.
 Where there is love there is life.
You are not a product of your circumstances but a product of your decisions
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.
Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants.
When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life; now that I am old I know that it is.
Money cannot buy peace of mind. It cannot heal ruptured relationships, or build meaning into a life that has none.
Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver.
Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people that they don't like.
Don't think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.
I made my money the old-fashioned way. I was very nice to a wealthy relative right before he died. 
When it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.
Money poisons you when you've got it, and starves you when you haven't.
We teach children to save their money. As an attempt to counteract thoughtless and selfish expenditure, that has value. But it is not positive; it does not lead the child into the safe and useful avenues of self-expression or self-expenditure. To teach a child to invest and use is better than to teach him to save.
Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.
The lack of money is the root of all evil.
A wise man should have money in his head, but not in his heart.
If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to.
You can be young without money, but you can't be old without it.
Many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.
It's good to have money and the things that money can buy, but it's good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure that you haven't lost the things that money can't buy. 
If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.
Money can't buy friends, but you can get a better class of enemy.
Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.
You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don't make money your goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can't take their eyes off you.
Money is power, freedom, a cushion, the root of all evil, the sum of blessings.
It doesn't matter about money; having it, not having it. Or having clothes, or not having them. You're still left alone with yourself in the end.
The safe way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket.
They who are of the opinion that Money will do everything, may very well be suspected to do everything for Money.
When I have money, I get rid of it quickly, lest it find a way into my heart.
Waste your money and you're only out of money, but waste your time and you've lost a part of your life.
Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and enlivens the other who turns it on his fellow man.
When a fellow says it ain't the money but the principle of the thing, it's the money.
Money is good for nothing unless you know the value of it by experience.
Parting is all we know of heaven, and all we need of hell.
Stop worrying about someone that isn't worried about you.
It means nothing to me. I have no opinion about it, and I don't care
Life is not lost by dying; life is lost minute by minute, day by dragging day, in all the thousand small uncaring ways.
It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.
Don't sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much there's nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you.
Not caring more about what other people think than what you think. That's freedom. 
The funny thing is, I'm so used to not caring what anyone says, good or bad, that unfortunately even when people say good things... I wish it made me feel good, but it doesn't. R
How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.
I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
That was how dishonesty and betrayal started, not in big lies but in small secrets.
I also think stress is related to control. When you're in charge of your life, you tend to not care about losing control of things that don't really matter like traffic jams.
It's better sometimes to not care than to be too good, people will always take what they never stress to get for granted, easy come, easy go.
Nowadays, I could not care less about making other people like me. I'm a good person, I don't need to do that anymore.
I gave you my whole heart. You gave it back in pieces.
Turning a breakup into a break-over ... We want women to know that as bad as it can be, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent yourself.
A weed is but an unloved flower.
It is not the most lovable individuals who stand more in need of love, but the most unlovable
break up in its final moments.
To be with a man who hasn't tried every line, who hasn't broken up with a woman every which way you can break up with them, is kind of nice.
It's afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didn't necessarily prove that you loved him
I just wanted to say, 'Thanks for all the good times, thanks for harping on me,' ... It was just to go and show them I don't care if they like me or not anymore.
By not caring too much about what people think, I'm able to think for myself and propagate ideas which are very often unpopular. And I succeed.
Life ends when you stop dreaming. Love ends when you stop caring. Friendship ends when you stop sharing.
Sometimes the only choice left to do is to stop caring. Make a pace and move forward no matter how it hurts because there is no reason to stay anymore.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
Explain to me how you having a problem with me is my problem
Without a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community
It means nothing to me. I have no opinion about it, and I don't care.
I believe that all wisdom consists in caring immensely for a few right things, and not caring a straw about the rest.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.
Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself.
Everyone can identify with a fragrant garden, with beauty of sunset, with the quiet of nature, with a warm and cozy cottage.
Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.
Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.
Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.
Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturbed.
Looking at beauty in the world, is the first step of purifying the mind.
I believe the world is incomprehensibly beautiful an endless prospect of magic and wonder.
May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.
Those who contemplate the beauty of the Earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.
On earth there is no heaven, but there are pieces of it.
A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is Earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.
Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.
The day, water, sun, moon, night - I do not have to purchase these things with money.
To sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon the verdant green hills is the most perfect refreshment.
The rich fire of the orange sunset gloriously announces the coming night.
Reading about nature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and listens carefully, he can learn more than what is in books, for they speak with the voice of God.
Earth and sky, woods and fields, lakes and rivers, the mountain and the sea, are excellent schoolmasters, and teach some of us more than we can ever learn from books.
Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.
We do not see nature with our eyes, but with our understandings and our hearts.
Let us learn to appreciate there will be times when the trees will be bare, and look forward to the time when we may pick the fruit. 
Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes—every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man.
Let the clean air blow the cobwebs from your body. Air is medicine.
Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts. There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature — the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter.
Nature is beautiful and you are in her bosom. That voice of comfort which speaks in the breezes of the morning, may visit your mind, that the delightful influences which the green leaves, the blue sky, the moonbeams and clouds of the evening diffuse over the universe, may in their powers of soul-healing, visit your day visions, is my desire and hope.
Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.
The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.
If you truly love Nature, you will find beauty everywhere.
The only real security in a relationship lies neither in looking back in nostalgia, nor forward in dread or anticipation, but living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now.
True nostalgia is an ephemeral composition of disjointed memories.
Nostalgia in reverse, the longing for yet another strange land, grew especially strong in spring.
Time was passing like a hand waving from a train I wanted to be on. I hope you never have to think about anything as much as I think about you.
Nostalgia is a process by which dreams become memories without ever coming true.
Nostalgia paints a smile on the stony face of the past.
Nostalgia is a necessary thing, I believe, and a way for all of us to find peace in that which we have accomplished, or even failed to accomplish. At the same time, if nostalgia precipitates actions to return to that fabled, rosy-painted time, particularly in one who believes his life to be a failure, then it is an empty thing, doomed to produce nothing but frustration and an even greater sense of failure.
Nostalgia is something we think of as fuzzy. But it's pain. Pain concerning the past.
The nostalgia of a moment's love can be an illusionary precipice from which we fall from truth; in heartbreak, what we escape to in the past is what tortures us in the present.
It was nostalgic in that painful way nostalgia could be.
Nostalgia is a file that removes the rough edges from the good old days.
Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.
Nostalgia is one of the legitimate and certainly one of the most enduring of human emotions; but the politics of nostalgia is at best distracting, at worst pernicious.
Nostalgia is a product of dissatisfaction and rage. ItÂ´s a settling of grievances between the present and the past.
You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time.
For me, nostalgia is an involuntary emotion. I think it's just a natural human response to loss.
Nostalgia, more than anything, gives us the shudder of our own imperfection. This is why with Chopin we feel so little like gods.
Nostalgia is a way of remembering people and places and things, and wishing things hadn't changed. It has a sweetness to it. Sadness is just well being sad.
Nostalgia is when you want things to stay the same. I know so many people staying in the same place.
People look back on those days through a thick veil of nostalgia, but life was hard if you were anything other than a rich, powerful white male.
It is strange how we hold on to the pieces of the past while we wait for our futures.
Nostalgia is a dangerous emotion, both because it is powerless to act in the real world, and because it glides so easily into hatred and resentment against those who have taken our Eden from us.
Nostalgia is a form of depression both for a society and an individual.
The whole nostalgia thing, and just sticking with what you always liked and what you know and not taking a chance on something or expanding. I think especially after a certain age.
Nostalgia is the aching realization that you can't go back again. The longing, no matter how intense, can never be met.
Nostalgia keeps dissolving the ironic narratives in which I have contained my past.
This was nostalgia in the literal Greek sense: the pain of not being able to return to one's home and family.
Nostalgia for what we have lost is more bearable than nostalgia for what we have never had, for the first involves knowledge and pleasure, the second only ignorance and pain.
Nostalgia locates desire in the past where it suffers no active conflict and can be yearned toward pleasantly.
The past is a candle at great distance: too close to let you quit, too far to comfort you.
Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.
To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art.
Our bodies are our gardens, to which our wills are our gardeners.
Diet is the essential key to all successful healing. 
Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are.
Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.
Life is a tragedy of nutrition.
Nutrition is the only remedy that can bring full recovery and can be used with any treatment. Remember, food is our best medicine!
The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not.
Your body is a temple, but only if you treat it as one.
Even in this high-tech age, the low-tech plant continues to be the key to nutrition and health.
One should eat to live; not live to eat.
Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. Put them together and you've got a kingdom.
The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.
When in doubt, use nutrition first.
We are indeed much more than what we eat, but what we eat can nevertheless help us to be much more than what we are.
Today more than 95% of all chronic disease is caused by food choice, toxic food ingredients, nutritional deficiencies, and lack of physical exercise.
Any food that requires enhancing by the use of chemical substances should in no way be considered a food.
The best and most efficient pharmacy is within your own system.
Fake food—I mean those patented substances chemically flavored and mechanically bulked out to kill the appetite and deceive the gut—is unnatural, almost immoral, a bane to good eating and good cooking.
Life expectancy would grow by leaps and bounds if green vegetables smelled as good as bacon.
I'm a product of good nutrition, cutting edge supplementation and hard training, and I'm an old guy.
Health food makes me sick.
When it comes to eating, you can sometimes help yourself more by helping yourself less. 
One man’s poison ivy is another man’s spinach. 
Plain fare gives as much pleasure as a costly diet, while bread and water confer the highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips.
Food is an important part of a balanced diet.
Old people shouldn’t eat health foods. They need all the preservatives they can get.
If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have the safest way to health.
Managing perfect body weight is not a complicated rocket science. Our body is made up of food which we eat during our day to day life. If we are overweight or obese at the moment then one thing is certain that the food which we eat is unhealthy.
Love is the greatest healer to be found.
Sometimes new love comes between old friends. Sometimes the best love was the one that was always there.
Love doesn't just sit there like a stone; it has to be made,like bread, remade all the time, made new.
Suddenly life has new meaning to me, there's beauty up above and things we never take notice of, you wake up suddenly you're in love.
New love can heal lost loves, but it cannot make you forget.
But new love only lasts so long, and then you crash back into the real people you are, and from as high as we were, it's a very long fall, and we hit the ground with a thud.
Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice, falling in love with you was beyond my control!
And think not you can direct the course of love, For love, If it finds you worthy, Directs your course.
Love unlocks doors and opens windows that weren't even there before.
Don't ignore the love you do have in your life by focusing on the love you don't.
Love may be harder to find in some people, but when they do love you know it must be something marvelous.
Sometimes it's a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence.
The greatest lovers are like twin blooms, each reflecting the passion and the glory of the other.
One's first love is always perfect until one meets one's second love.
Sow a seed and the earth will yield you a flower. Dream your dream to the sky and it will bring you your beloved.
Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.
Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love but don't put your life on hold waiting for love
I think perhaps love comes from finding someone you feel utterly comfortable with, someone who makes you comfortable with yourself. It's like...finding yourself, or maybe it's like finding the other part of yourself.
Love can only be found through the act of loving.
Love is never wasted. To love is the greatest gift.
The best way to love is to love like you have never been hurt.
It is a risk to love. What if it doesn't work out? Ah, but what if it does.
There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice.
Love isn't finding a perfect person. It's seeing an imperfect person perfectly.
It is difficult to know at what moment love begins; it is less difficult to know that it has begun.
The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.
Love does not care to define and is never in a hurry to do so.
All love shifts and changes. I don't know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time.
It is the things in common that make relationships enjoyable, but it is the little differences that make them interesting.
Before we can have a successful relationship with anyone, we first need a perfect personal relationship.
Those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth.
Inquire not what are the opinions of any one; but inquire what is truth.
If you want me to treat your ideas with more respect, get some better ideas.
Opinions, like weapons, are often made for defense as well as offense.
He who has no opinion of his own, but depends upon the opinion and taste of others, is a slave.
If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinion for or against.
The greatest deception which men incur proceeds from their opinions.
Everyone has the right to their own opinionâ€¦ Yours is just wrong.
The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind.
You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.
The fewer the facts, the stronger the opinion.
Public opinion is no more than this: what people think that other people think.
There are as many opinions as there are people.
It is not truth, but opinion that can travel the world without a passport.
An opinion which excites no opposition at all is not worth having!
People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.
Never judge someone by the opinion of others.
If you fuel your journey on the opinions of others, you are going to run out of gas.
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.
It's funny how people have strong opinions on things they know nothing about.
Opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them.
Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality.
Just because they disagree, doesn't mean you ain't right.
Don't let your opinion sway your judgment.
Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.
The opinion which other people have of you is their problem not yours.
If you're going to say what you want to say, you're going to hear what you don't want to hear.
The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane.
There are as many opinions as there are experts.
Your opinion is not my reality.
Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it.
When the goal seems difficult to reach, take a break but never give up.
Convince your enemy that he will gain very little by attacking you; this will diminish his enthusiasm
Those who don't know how to suffer are the worst off. There are times when the only correct thing we can do is to bear out troubles until a better day.
If you expect life to be easy, challenges will seem difficult. If you accept that challenges may occur, life will be easier.
Never give in to the obstacles that lie in your path towards the achievement of your dreams.
Don't settle for your human capacity. Live up to your God-given potential.
Don't run from your weakness, you will only give it strength.
Always follow your dreams, even if they lead you down a few dark alleys.
Some people will just go with the flow of things and sway in life, while others will fight against the currents and go upstream to reach their destiny.
One of the secrets of life is to make stepping stones out of stumbling blocks.
Others can stop you temporarily -- you are the only one who can do it permanently.
Today is a new day. Yesterday's mistakes cannot affect today's possibilities unless you dwell on them.
Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Every calamity is to be overcome by endurance.
You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
Choose rather to be strong of soul than strong of body.
Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.
You have to accept whatever comes and the only important thing is that you meet it with courage and with the best that you have to give.
Standing in the inspiring vision of my future, I boldly take every step - large and small - with courage and intent.
Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them.
Thinking will not overcome fear but action will.
You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, "I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along." . . . You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
Choose what lies in the shadows to be a matter for discovery and adventure, rather than fear.
Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.
Conquering any difficulty always gives one a secret joy, for it means pushing back a boundary-line and adding to one's liberty.
Never complain about your troubles; they are responsible for more than half of your income.
To solve any problem, here are three questions to ask yourself: First, what could I do? Second, what could I read? And third, who could I ask?
It is a good rule to face difficulties at the time they arise and not allow them to increase unacknowledged.
Organization and education, when they interact with each other, they strengthen each other, they are mutually supportive.
An organization, no matter how well designed, is only as good as the people who live and work in it.
Organization isn't about perfection; it's about efficiency, reducing stress and clutter, saving time and money and improving your overall quality of life.
If you want people to parade your organization, aspire to have increase.
The organization of information actually creates new information.
An organization's ability to learn, and translate that learning into action rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage.
The organization is a way for people to find us and deal with us and know how we operate.
In the successful organization, no detail is too small to escape close attention.
The organization and constant onward sweep of this movement exemplifies the resentment of the many toward the selfishness, greed and the neglect of the few.
The success of an organization will depend on the people you surround yourself with.
If you want to change the culture, you will have to start by changing the organization.
No organization ever created an innovation. People innovate, not companies.
This organization is created to prevent you from going to hell. It isn't created to take you to heaven.
The more successful an organization becomes, the more difficult it is to deal with.
An organization will tend to grow only when the advantages that can be gotten from directing the work of additional employees are less than the transaction costs of managing them.
The key to success in any organization is identifying, developing, and empowering the right people.
One of the functions of an organization, of any organism, is to anticipate the future, so that those relationships can persist over time.
The structure of software systems tend to reflect the structure of the organization that produce them
An organization needs to be constantly refreshed.
Organization takes the fun out of everything.
Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.
Once an organization loses its spirit of pioneering and rests on its early work, its progress stops.
In a balanced organization, working towards a common objective, there is success.
An organization is a set of relationships that are persistent over time.
Organization can never be a substitute for initiative and for judgment.
We use the word organization to mean both the state of being organized and the groups that do the organizing.
Every organization should tolerate rebels who tell the emperor he has no clothes.
Commit yourself to an organization or cause that genuinely fires you up.
Every organization has to prepare for the abandonment of everything it does.
First comes thought; then organization of that thought, into ideas and plans; then transformation of those plans into reality. The beginning, as you will observe, is in your imagination.
A closed mouth catches no flies. 
Aim for the stars. 
Aim high in your career but stay humble in your heart. 
Do not leave for tomorrow what you can do today. 
First come, first served. 
If the eyes didn't see, the hands wouldn't take.
Manana (tomorrow) is often the busiest day of the week. 
New day, new fate.
No time like the present. 
Once the rice is pudding, it's too late to reclaim the rice. 
One who waits for chance, may wait a year.
Opportunities come but do not linger.
Strike while the iron is hot. 
When one door shuts, another opens. 
Who waiteth for dead man's shoes will go long barefoot. 
Whoever wins the war gets to write the history. 
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
How much I missed, simply because I was afraid of missing it.
I will prepare and some day my chance will come.
Our most significant opportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty.
Unfortunately, there seems to be far more opportunity out there than ability.... We should remember that good fortune often happens when opportunity meets with preparation.
Sometimes opportunities float right past your nose. Work hard, apply yourself, and be ready. When an opportunity comes you can grab it.
No great man ever complains of want of opportunity.
Time is limited and some opportunities never repeat themselves.
Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared. 
Opportunities will come and go, but if you do nothing about them, so will you.
There comes a moment in every life when the Universe presents you with an opportunity to rise to your potential. An open door that only requires the heart to walk through, seize it and hang on. The choice is never simple. It's never easy. It's not supposed to be. But those who travel this path have always looked back and realized that the test was always about the heart. ...The rest is just practice.
Opportunity never knocks. It hangs thick in the air all around you. You breathe it unthinking, and dissipate it with your sighs.
It always seem impossible until it's done.
Organizing is just one big game of Tetris.
Managing your time without setting priorities is like shooting randomly and calling whatever you hit the target.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Cleaning and organizing is a practice, not a project.
Organizing is what you do before you do something, so that when you do it, it is not all mixed up.
Once you have a clear idea of your priorities â€“ that is your values, goals and high leverage activities, organize around them.
Order is the sanity of the mind, the health of the body, the peace of the city, the security of the state. Like beams in a house or bones to a body, so is order to all things.
The best way to get something done is to begin.
Clutter is nothing more than postponed decisions.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Organizating isn't about perfection; it's about efficiency, reducing stress and clutter, saving time and money and improving your overall quality of life. 
To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.
Successful organizing is based on the recognition that people get organized because they, too, have a vision.
With organization comes empowerment.
Stop waiting for the perfect time to get organized. Take this moment and make some progress.
The key to organizing an alternative society is to organize people around what they can do, and more importantly, what they want to do.
Clutter is nothing more than a series of deferred decisions stacked on top of each other.
Organize yourself before you try to organize anything else.
Organization is not an option; it is a fundamental survival skill and distinct competitive advantage.
Clutter is what you end up with when you have more stuff than you need.
Good order is the foundation of all things.
For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned.
The desire for order is the only order in the world.
Organizing is a journey, not a destination.
Being organized is all about the ABC's: Awareness and Action, Balance and Beliefs, Choices and consistency.
Organize, don't agonize.
Organizing has to be a 12-month endeavor.
Being organized isn't about getting rid of everything you own or trying to become a different person: it's about living the way you want to live, but better.
Have a time and place for everything, and do everything in its time and place, and you will not only accomplish more, but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying.
When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the area of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.
A poem begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a lovesickness.
Poetry is the opening and closing of a door, leaving those who look through to guess about what is seen during the moment.
Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason. 
Poetry is the language in which man explores his own amazement. 
Poetry is thoughts that breathe, and words that burn. 
Poetry can be dangerous, especially beautiful poetry, because it gives the illusion of having had the experience without actually going through it. 
Poetry is what in a poem makes you laugh, cry, prickle, be silent, makes your toe nails twinkle, makes you want to do this or that or nothing, makes you know that you are alone in the unknown world, that your bliss and suffering is forever shared and forever all your own. 
Poetry is ordinary language raised to the Nth power. Poetry is boned with ideas, nerved and blooded with emotions, all held together by the delicate, tough skin of words. 
Poetry, whose material is language, is perhaps the most human and least worldly of the arts, the one in which the end product remains closest to the thought that inspired it. 
Poetry is, above all, an approach to the truth of feeling . . .. A fine poem will seize your imagination intellectually - that is, when you reach it, you will reach it intellectually too, but the way is through emotion, through what we call feeling. 
Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things. 
Poetry is the journal of a sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air. 
Poetry is, at bottom, a criticism of life. 
In this poor body, composed of one hundred bones and nine openings, is something called spirit, a flimsy curtain swept this way and that by the slightest breeze. It is spirit, such as it is, which led me to poetry, at first little more than a pastime, then the full business of my life. There have been times when my spirit, so dejected, almost gave up the quest, other times when it was proud, triumphant. So it has been from the very start, never finding peace with itself, always doubting the worth of what it makes. 
Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject 
Poetry, like the moon, does not advertise anything. 
Poetry is perfect verbs hunting for elusive nouns. 
Poetry is finer and more philosophical than history; for poetry expresses the universal, and history only the particular. 
Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does. 
In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite. 
Poetry is either something that lives like fire inside you --like music to the musician or Marxism to the Communist --or else it is nothing, an empty formalized bore around which pedants can endlessly drone their notes and explanations. 
Poetry implies the whole truth, philosophy expresses only a particle of it. 
I don't see how poetry can ever be easy... Real poetry, the thick, dense, intense, complicated stuff that lives and endures, requires blood sweat; blood and sweat are essential elements in poetry as well as behind it. 
Poetry is the impish attempt to paint the color of the wind. 
An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence. 
Poetry is indispensable --if I only knew what for. 
Poetry must have something in it that is barbaric, vast and wild.
Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds with nature and itself. He who has a contempt for poetry, cannot have much respect for himself, or for anything else. 
The object, Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the object, Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable, to a certain extent, in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose. 
Until we have a passionate love for our Lord in the Most Blessed Sacrament we shall accomplish nothing.
Love, genuine passionate love, was his for the first time.
If there is no passionate love for Christ at the center of everything, we will only jingle and jangle our way across the world, merely making a noise as we go.
Passionate love produces distorted visions of actual people. Men who are too much in love expect such extraordinary happiness from marriage that they are frequently disappointed.
When I am with you, the only place I want to be is closer.
The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough.
The simple lack of her is more to me than others' presence.
We loved with a love that was more than love.
My heart beats faster as you take my hand, my love grows stronger as you touch my soul.
Her lips on his could tell him better than all her stumbling words.
Love is that splendid triggering of human vitality... the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else.
I wanted the heat and the sweat and the passion of a man that I could love and trust. And I wanted to give myself to him: not for advantage, but for desire.
Romantic love is a passionate spiritual-emotional-sexual attachment between a man and a woman that reflects a high regard for the value of each other's person.
There's this place in me where your fingerprints still rest, your kisses still linger, and your whispers softly echo. It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me.
We efface an hour by passionate love, without twists, without aftertaste. When it is finished, it is not finished, we lie still in each other's arms lulled by our love, by tenderness -- sensuality in which the whole being can participate.
We lie in each other's arms eyes shut and fingers open and all the colors of the world pass through our bodies like strings of fire.
Ancient lovers believed a kiss would literally unite their souls, because the spirit was said to be carried in one's breath.
'Passion' a word which involves so many feelings. I feel it when we touch; I feel it when we kiss; I feel it when I look at you. For you are my passion; my one true love.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach.
I can no longer think of anything but you. In spite of myself, my imagination carries me to you. I grasp you, I kiss you, I caress you, a thousand of the most amorous caresses take possession of me.
My heart to you is given: Oh, do give yours to me; We'll lock them up together, and throw away the key.
My love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break...
I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days - three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.
Two lovers in the rain have no need of an umbrella.
You know you're in love when you don't want to fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life.
I can forget my very existence in a deep kiss of you.
Come, live in my heart and pay no rent.
But you've slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart.
We would be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright.
Don't wait for a perfect person to love. Love a person and make him or her perfect with your power of love.
One day you will kiss a man you can't breathe without and find that breath is of little consequence.
When we touch, our Gods lay down their weapons and I can forgive every trespass.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of.
Love is not the opposite of power. Love is power. Love is the strongest power there is.
The only way love can last a lifetime is if it's unconditional. The truth is this: love is not determined by the one being loved, but rather by the one choosing to love.
Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.
Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get, only with what you are expecting to give, which is everything.
Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.
As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.
To love oneself is the beginning of a life long romance.
There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.
Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it.
We loved with a love that was more than love.
We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.
Take away love and our earth is a tomb.
Love is an exploding cigar we willingly smoke.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love.
Love is a dramatic driving force, the most powerful potion that we drink willingly.
With the power of love; our two hearts can enlighten the whole world.
Let the power of your love change the world, but never let the problems of this world change the beauty of your love.
You don't love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.
Love is an involuntary gift that manifests unplanned.
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you. I could walk through my garden forever.
So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
There and then, sitting beside her and within the strength of my adoration, I felt invincible.
The heart becomes warmer when the mild heat of love is coming from two persons. one is in eternal cold and desolation without feeling the friction of love.
Behind every argument lies someone's ignorance. 
Once you reach the top, take care as the only way left to go is down. 
One man may be more cunning than another, but not more cunning than everybody else. 
Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a great deal more saucy. When you have bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of a piece; but it is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.
The devil wipes his breech with poor folks' pride. 
The higher you climb, the heavier you fall. 
A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you
Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition is gone, pride is gone.
We are rarely proud when we are alone.
The proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing. But because he wants to do it in his own strength, he is fighting not with man, but with God.
Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.
God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Pride is pleasure arising from a man's thinking too highly of himself.
Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.
Never look down on anybody unless you are helping them up.
Most of the trouble in the world is caused by people wanting to be important.
Pride is a personal commitment. It is an attitude which separates excellence from mediocrity.
Airs of importance are the credentials of impotence.
Pride is the mask of one's own faults.
In general, pride is at the bottom of all great mistakes.
Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurts, not to hurt others.
Pride must die in you, or nothing of heaven can live in you.
Pride makes us long for a solution to things - a solution, a purpose, a final cause; but the better telescopes become, the more stars appear.
The proud wish God would agree with them. They are not interested in changing their opinions to agree with God's.
Pride is the mother of arrogance.
He who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much; but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken.
Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.
It is more often from 'pride' than from ignorance that we are so obstinately opposed to current opinions; we find the first places taken, and we do not want to be the last.
There is nothing that will kill a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself.
To know a man, observe how he wins his object, rather than how he loses it; for when we fail our pride supports us; when we succeed, it betrays us.
You can't solve a dignity problem with military force.
We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
Every problem has in it the seeds of its own solution. If you don't have any problems, you don't get any seeds.
Inside of every problem lies an opportunity.
The greatest problem in the world today is intolerance. Everyone is so intolerant of each other.
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. 
Never bring the problem solving stage into the decision making stage. Otherwise, you surrender yourself to the problem rather than the solution.
Don't bother people for help without first trying to solve the problem yourself.
When you confront a problem you begin to solve it.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem.
The world's problem is not too many people, but lack of political and economic freedom.
The definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself.
To every problem there is already a solution, whether you know it or not. To every sum in there is already a correct answer, whether the mathematician has found it or not.
If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges. 
A problem is a chance for you to do your best.
Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem. 
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.
The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out. Every mind is a building filled with archaic furniture. Clean out a corner of your mind and creativity will instantly fill it.
The problem is not that there are problems. The problem is expecting otherwise and thinking that having problems is a problem. 
Corruption is not a problem just for some countries; this is a global issue.
When you have solved the problem of controlling the attention of the child, you have solved the entire problem of its education. 
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
To a poet the mere making of a poem can seem to solve the problem of truth...but only a problem of art is solved in poetry.
A problem well stated is a problem half-solved.
Loneliness is the universal problem of rich people.
If you procrastinate when faced with a big difficult problem... break the problem into parts, and handle one part at a time.
The best way to resolve any problem in the human world is for all sides to sit down and talk.
Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership. 
No problem is so formidable that you can't walk away from it.
Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort.
Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.
Quality is not what happens when what you do matches your intentions. It is what happens when what you do matches your customers' expectations.
Quality is the result of a carefully constructed cultural environment. It has to be the fabric of the organization, not part of the fabric.
Quality is not an act, it is a habit.
Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.
Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.
Quality is free. It's not a gift, but it's free. The 'unquality' things are what cost money.
Things of quality have no fear of time.
If you believe in unlimited quality and act in all your business dealings with total integrity, the rest will take care of itself.
Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.
If you want a quality, act as if you already had it.
Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.
Give them quality. That's the best kind of advertising.
Quality is the best business plan.
The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.
Quality questions create a quality life. Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.
The quality of an organization can never exceed the quality of the minds that make it up.
Quality, quality, quality: never waver from it, even when you don't see how you can afford to keep it up. When you compromise, you become a commodity and then you die.
Quality isn't something that can be argued into an article or promised into it. It must be put there. If it isn't put there, the finest sales talk in the world won't act as a substitute.
Quality is a proud and soaring thing.
The bitterness of poor quality remains long after low pricing is forgotten!
The quality, not the longevity, of one's life is what is important.
It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity.
Quality has to be caused, not controlled.
Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for. A product is not quality because it is hard to make and costs a lot of money, as manufacturers typically believe. This is incompetence. Customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value. Nothing else constitutes quality.
Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions.
Quality is such an attractive banner that sometimes we think we can get away with just waving it, without doing the hard work necessary to achieve it.
Make the workmanship surpass the materials.
In the race for quality, there is no finish line
Smoking is just like farting with the poisonous elements.
Smoking is one of the leading causes of all statistics.
Much smoking kills live men and cures dead swine.
Every time you light up a cigarette, you are saying that your life isn't worth living.
No one can quit smoking for you, or make you want to change your life. No one can make you do anything that you don't want to do.
Today just might be the best day to start seriously thinking about quitting smoking.
To quit smoking, you must first want to quit, but then you must also do the quitting.
Quitting smoking is rather a marathon than a sprint. It is not a one-time attempt, but a longer effort.
Quitting cigarettes might be the hardest thing to do in life, but at least you will have one.
You're always better off if you quit smoking; it's never too late.
Every time you try to quit smoking you are actually getting closer to staying smoke free.
There's nothing quite like tobacco: it's the passion of decent folk, and whoever lives without tobacco doesn't deserve to live.
Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life.
A cigarette is the only consumer product which when used as directed kills its consumer.
Smoking is hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs.
Smoking is suicide by instalments.
Smoking is neither an art nor a sport. Better to liberate yourself before the body retaliates, for its vengeance would be a furious blow enthused out of all the bygone years' mercy you thanklessly thought you were entitled to.
The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror â€“ not the glamor and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray.
Rather than you smoking a cigarette, the cigarette is really smoking you.
Smoking must be harder than not smoking. For the latter does not require any action.
If you resolve to give up smoking, drinking, and loving, you don't actually live longer; it just seems longer.
Cigarettes are a classy way to commit suicide.
If quitting smoking seems hard right now, it is exactly what you should start doing.
The best way to stop smoking is to just stop â€“ no ifs, and or butts.
Quitting smoking can be a very good test of ones character. Pass the test and you will have accomplished so much more than just get rid of one bad habit.
It is easier to prevent bad habits than to break them.
Smoking kills half of all lifetime smokers.
If knowing about the dangers of smoking were enough, almost no one would smoke.
Not only will giving up cigarettes put more money in your pocket, your body will thank you for it.
Cigarette smoking is clearly identified as the chief, preventable cause of death in our society.
The quarterback is the leader of the team and the quarterback is the one that has the ball in his hands every single play.
The quarterback is an extension of the coach and has a certain type of swagger mentality, on and off the field.
Any time you can do that and the quarterback shows some outward emotion some negative emotion you know you are in his head and you've affected him. It's satisfying.
Quarterback is not a position that you come in having not played it your whole life.
That's the key to defending any quarterback: to make them throw before they want to throw.
If you're a quarterback, you want everything on your shoulders. You want to be the one to make the decisions.
Every quarterback can throw a ball; every running back can run; every receiver is fast; but that mental toughness that you talk about translates into competitiveness.
Any quarterback that understands what the offense is really about is going to succeed.
Quarterback is a lot of footwork. It's mechanics, how you step back, what you do on a trap or power or play action.
If you're a quarterback, you want everything on your shoulders. You want to be the one to make the decisions.
A quarterback's best friend is a running game, It's such an advantage for a quarterback when your team has a good running game. It really helps open up the passing game.
Young quarterbacks do well because they have a great defense.
Quarterbacks are untouchable nowadays. If you hit a quarterback too hard, or if you fall on him with too much weight which is a judgment thing from a professional standpoint you're going to get flagged.
In football, it's the ultimate team sport. You have to have good people around you as a quarterback for things to happen.
A quarterback that goes out and performs for you and is a franchise quarterback is more valuable than a player playing another position, but there's a lot more risk there. It's a more difficult position to play, and there are lot more failures.
Footwork is the biggest element to any quarterback game because if it's off, it will mess with your mechanics.
If the quarterback throws the ball in the endzone and the wide receiver catches it, it's a touchdown.
The quarterback must go down, and he must go down hard.
As a quarterback, you have to love it. As much as you like to turn around and hand the ball off the whole traditional football game as a quarterback, you gotta love putting it in the air.
Quarterbacks need to make their team better. If it's a bad team, they can even make a bad team better.
You never really know about a quarterback until he plays in a real game.
Game day can be emotional, and there are a lot of ups and downs throughout a game, but as a quarterback, you have to be able to see the bigger picture, steady that ship, get all the guys focused in on the task at hand, and keep the thing moving.
I realize that as the quarterback, you have to assume some sort of leadership role because you have to talk in the huddle on every play, and you're essentially giving out orders to the team. But in my mind, I have to prove myself on the field before I can start asserting a leadership role.
You need to make sure you're going exactly where your guy goes in press coverage. In zone, you can read the quarterback and his eyes a bit to determine where he's going. You don't get the opportunity in press coverage to read the quarterback, so it's all on you.
Don't let the Monday morning quarterbacks stop you from being bold. You've got to set a high bar.
If you want to coach you have three rules to follow to win. One, surround yourself with people who can't live without football. I've had a lot of them. Two, be able to recognize winners. They come in all forms. And, three, have a plan for everything. A plan for practice, a plan for the game. A plan for being ahead, and a plan for being behind 20-0 at half, with your quarterback hurt and the phones dead, with it raining cats and dogs and no rain gear because the equipment man left it at home.
The quarterback is in charge of the chuck wagon. He's handing it out here and there, but he can't just throw it out there indiscriminately or the wolves will get him.
That's one thing you learn as a quarterback: focus. The better you are at focusing and the more you can continue to stay focused for a four-hour stage and really be zeroed in on what is happening, the better you play, the longer you play.
I've never had a quarterback-run-driven offense. We don't run designed plays where we snap the ball directly to the quarterback and he's just running it. If the defense is cheating and overcompensating for your running back, then the quarterback needs to keep (it) honest.
Something you're aware of being a quarterback coming here-you have expectations, and you want to live up to those.

Sometimes, you have to look back in order to understand the things that lie ahead.
Each person you meet is an aspect of yourself, clamoring for love.
Living in a way that reflects one's values is not just about what you do, it is also about how you do things.

Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
Some of us think holding on makes us strong; but sometimes it is letting go.
Just because a relationship ends, it doesn't mean it's not worth having.
Pleasure of love lasts but a moment, Pain of love lasts a lifetime.
Love is unconditional, relationships are not.
Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.
Relationships end, but they don't end your life. But people do often spending more time finding out about failed relationships than finding successful ones.
Celebrate endings - for they precede new beginnings.
So often the end of a love affair is death by a thousand cuts, so often its survival is life by a thousand stitches.
In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people.
The end of a relationship is not always a failure. Sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something. In these cases, it is not a matter of fault from either person. Some things cannot be, it's as simple as that.
A sad thing in life is that sometimes you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never bound to be and you just have to let go.
Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never.
To meet, to know, to love and then to part, is the sad tale of many a heart.
Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing.
The loss of love is not nearly as painful as our resistance to accepting it is.
If people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were, only see you for the mistakes you've made, if they don't realize that you are not your mistakes, then they have to go.
Even the best of friends face conflicts, but that needn't mean the end of the relationship.
If a relationship is to evolve, it must go through a series of endings.
Any time you end a relationship, and everyone has ended plenty in their life, it's always a tough thing and hard to get over.
Death ends a life, not a relationship.
If love breaks more than a heart, maybe it's a sign and time to step out.
We mistakenly assume that if our partners love us they will react and behave in certain ways - the ways we react and behave when we love someone.
Almost all of our relationships begin and most of them continue as forms of mutual exploitation, a mental or physical barter, to be terminated when one or both parties run out of goods.
Nothing in the universe can stop you from letting go and starting over.
Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Think about any attachments that are depleting your emotional reserves. Consider letting them go.
You can love them, forgive them, want good things for them ... but still move on without them.
Ever has it been that loves knows not its own death until the hour of separation.
The heart was made to be broken.

To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.

The living owe it to those who no longer can speak to tell their story for them.

Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
A feeling of sadness and longing, That is not akin to pain, And resembles sorrow only As the mist resembles the rain.
Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.
It's easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die.
Sorrow is one of the vibrations that prove the fact of living.
My feeling is that there is nothing in life but refraining from hurting others, and comforting those who are sad.
To fall in love is awfully simple, but to fall out of love is simply awful.
There is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy.
Sadness is almost never anything but a form of fatigue.
Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.
Absence from whom we love is worse than death, and frustrates hope severer than despair.
As the light begins to intensify, so does my misery, and I wonder how it is possible to hurt so much when nothing is wrong.
I have a thousand reasons to die and many millions of tears to cry.
So much sadness exists in the world that we are all under obligation to contribute as much joy as lies within our powers.
Behind every sweet smile, there is a bitter sadness that no one can ever see and feel.
There is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow.
Sadness is a super important thing not to be ashamed about but to include in our lives. One of the bigger problems with sadness or depression is there's so much shame around it. If you have it you're a failure. You are felt as being very unattractive.
How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.
Tears are words that need to be written.
Sadness usually results from one of the following causes either when a man does not succeed, or is ashamed of his success.
This is what it felt like to have a broken heart. It felt less like a cracking down the middle and more like she had swallowed it whole and it sat bruised and bleeding in the pit of her stomach.
Sweet is the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart.
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.
You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.
Half of the secular unrest and dismal, profane sadness of modern society comes from the vain ideas that every man is bound to be a critic for life.
Nothing records the effects of a sad life so graphically as the human body.
The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.
Man could not live if he were entirely impervious to sadness. Many sorrows can be endured only by being embraced, and the pleasure taken in them naturally has a somewhat melancholy character.
The beginning and the decline of love are both marked by the embarrassment the lovers feel to be alone together.
You were as kind as you could be, and even though you're gone, you still mean the world to me.
You are my sweetest downfall. I loved you first, I loved you first.
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word. We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard.
Well, I've been afraid of changing 'cause I've built my life around you. But time makes you bolder even children get older and I'm getting older too.
Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing.
I will wait for you till the day I can forget you or till the day you realize you cannot forget me
There is a distinct, awful pain that comes with loving someone more than they love you.
Walking alone is not difficult but when we have walked a mile worth a thousand years with someone then coming back alone is what is difficult.
There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not.
Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.
Loving can cost a lot but not loving always costs more, and those who fear to love often find that want of love is an emptiness that robs the joy from life.
Relationships are like glass. Sometimes it's better to leave them broken than try to hurt yourself putting it back together.
If we must part forever, Give me but one kind word to think upon, And please myself with, while my heart's breaking.
Remember me with smiles and laughs, for that's how I'll remember you. If you can only remember me with sadness and tears, then don't remember me at all.
The magic of first love is our ignorance that it can ever end.
Where there is love there is pain.
To love anything is to realize that it might be lost.
Perhaps a great love is never returned.
Falling out of love is very enlightening; for a short while you see the world with new eyes.
How do you know that love is gone? If you said you would be there by seven, you get there by nine, and he or she has not called the police yet—it’s gone.
You gave me wings to fly, then took away my sky.
To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible God.
Love without return is like a question without an answer.
We must get our hearts broken sometimes. This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something.
I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken—and I’d rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.
It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace. 
Never love with all your heart, it only ends in breaking.
Everything is temporary if you give it enough time.
The struggle you're in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow. Don't give up.
Strength comes from struggle. When you learn to see your struggles as opportunities to become stronger, better, wiser, then your thinking shifts from 'I can't do this' to 'I must do this.'
Sometimes, struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If we were to go through our life without any obstacles, we would be crippled. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. Give every opportunity a chance, leave no room for regrets.
The harder the struggle, the more glorious the triumph. Self-realization demands very great struggle.
The struggle of life is one of our greatest blessings. It makes us patient, sensitive, and Godlike. It teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
Don't compare your struggles to anyone else's. Don't get discouraged by the success of others. Make your own path and never give up. 
We grow because we struggle, we learn and overcome.
If there is no Struggle, there is no progress.
The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory.
Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.
Whatever the struggle, continue the climb. It may be only one step to the summit.
Every struggle in your life has shaped you into the person you are today. Be thankful for the hard times, they can only make you stronger.
The struggle of my life created empathy - I could relate to pain, being abandoned, having people not love me.
The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle.
Struggle is strengthening. Battling with evil gives us the power to battle evil even more.
I'm thankful for my struggle because without it I wouldn't have stumbled across my strength.
All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.
Once all struggle is grasped, miracles are possible.
Believe me, the reward is not so great without the struggle.
Struggle is the food from which change is made, and the best time to make the most of a struggle is when it's right in front of your face. 
I disagree. I look at struggle as an opportunity to grow. True struggle happens when you can sense what is not working for you and you're willing to take the appropriate action to correct the situation. Those who accomplish change are willing to engage the struggle.
We all struggle with something, and need help. Whatever it is that you can't conquer on your own, I encourage you to give it to the Lord; He can fix anything! Your struggle is no more because VICTORY has taken it's place!! Have a VICTORIOUS day!
The more you've struggled to heal and love yourself, the more inspiring your story will be to others when you come out the other side full of triumph, awareness, and honour. Don't give up. Your struggle today is the source of your wisdom tomorrow.
In everyday struggle maintain your cool and emotion. To heal a wound you need to stop touching it. Keeping yourself calm in times of stress will not only have immediate smoothing effects; it can also, over time, help you lead a healthier, happier life.
Unfortunately this earth is not. a fairy-land, but a struggle for life, perfectly natural and therefore extremely harsh.
The way I see things, the way I see life, I see it as a struggle. And there's a great deal of reward I have gained coming to that understanding -- that existence is a struggle.
To have striven, to have made the effort, to have been true to certain ideals - this alone is worth the struggle.
The life of man is a struggle on earth. But without a cross, without a struggle, we get nowhere. The victory will be ours if we continue our efforts courageously, even when at times they appear futile.
Sometimes, struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If we were to go through our life without any obstacles, we would be crippled. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. Give every opportunity a chance, leave no room for regrets.
No matter what struggles I come across, I will keep going, because I have the will and strength to overcome it all. All my greatest accomplishments, I once thought I would never achieve, but I keep on succeeding every challenge that faces me. No matter what is beyond my control, nothing will ever make me less than a woman. I am and will always be a powerful woman.
The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.
A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning.
The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching.
A good teacher, like a good entertainer first must hold his audience's attention, then he can teach his lesson.
Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.
A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.
Teaching is leaving a vestige of one self in the development of another. And surely the student is a bank where you can deposit your most precious treasures.
I have come to believe that a great teacher is a great artist and that there are as few as there are any other great artists. Teaching might even be the greatest of the arts since the medium is the human mind and spirit.
Teachers who inspire know that teaching is like cultivating a garden, and those who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.
The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.
In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn.
Teaching should be full of ideas instead of stuffed with facts.
No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge. The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness. If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.
I never teach my pupils, I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.
Teachers, I believe, are the most responsible and important members of society because their professional efforts affect the fate of the earth.
The dream begins, most of the time, with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you on to the next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called truth.
A good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others. 
The future of the world is in my classroom today, a future with the potential for good or bad... Several future presidents are learning from me today; so are the great writers of the next decades, and so are all the so-called ordinary people who will make the decisions in a democracy. I must never forget these same young people could be the thieves and murderers of the future. Only a teacher? Thank God I have a calling to the greatest profession of all! I must be vigilant every day, lest I lose one fragile opportunity to improve tomorrow.
There's no word in the language I revere more than 'teacher.' My heart sings when a kid refers to me as his teacher, and it always has. I've honored myself and the entire family of man by becoming a teacher.
The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.
If kids come to us from strong, healthy functioning families, it makes our job easier. If they do not come to us from strong, healthy, functioning families, it makes our job more important.
Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.
The man (or woman) who can make hard things easy is the educator.
The test of a good teacher is not how many questions he can ask his pupils that they will answer readily, but how many questions he inspires them to ask him which he finds it hard to answer.
Teaching kids to count is fine, but teaching them what counts is best.
If we teach today's students as we taught yesterday's, we rob them of tomorrow.
Teaching is the one profession that creates all other professions.
If a child can't learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.
There are two kinds of teachers: the kind that fills you with so much quail shot that you can't move, and the kind that just gives you a little prod behind and you jump to the skies.
The greatest sign of success for a teacher ... is to be able to say, 'The children are now working as if I did not exist.'
All that really belongs to us is time; even he who has nothing else has that.
No use thinking of the past for its gone, don't think of the future because it has to come, think of the present because thats where you are.
Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.
Time is what we want most, but... what we use worst.
Time is a cruel thief to rob us of our former selves. We lose as much to life as we do to death.
If time flies when you're having fun, it hits the afterburners when you don't think you're having enough.
If we take care of the moments, the years will take care of themselves.
Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.
Time is the longest distance between two places.
Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time,' is like saying, 'I don't want to.
Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.
The timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.
The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.
Suspect each moment, for it is a thief, tiptoeing away with more than it brings.
The common man is not concerned about the passage of time, the man of talent is driven by it.
Old Time, that greatest and longest established spinner of all!.... his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his hands are mutes.
Time = life; therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life.
Don't be fooled by the calendar. There are only as many days in the year as you make use of. One man gets only a week's value out of a year while another man gets a full year's value out of a week.
We all have our time machines. Some take us back, they're called memories. Some take us forward, they're called dreams.
Time ripens all things; with Time all things are revealed; Time is the father of truth.
Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.
For disappearing acts, it's hard to beat what happens to the eight hours supposedly left after eight of sleep and eight of work.
It's a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up.
Time is like the wind, it lifts the light and leaves the heavy.
There is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at, and who steals what is most precious to men: time.
Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.
Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing.
A man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life.
Time is a brisk wind, for each hour it brings something new... but who can understand and measure its sharp breath, its mystery and its design?
The trust of the innocent is the liar's most useful tool.
Learning to trust is one of life's most difficult tasks.
You may be deceived if you trust too much, but you will live in torment if you don't trust enough.
Men trust their ears less than their eyes.
I cannot trust a man to control others who cannot control himself.
Sometimes, the people that love you the most turn out to be the people you will trust the least.
I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.
Trust is like a vase.. once it's broken, though you can fix it the vase will never be same again.
We're never so vulnerable than when we trust someone - but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy.
Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.
He who does not trust enough, will not be trusted.
Trust in a relationship is very crucial. Without trust, a relationship cannot last as a healthy and happy bond.
Trust is something that is difficult to establish. It is very fragile that needs to be taken care of. Once trust breaks or shatters into pieces, it is very difficult to rebuild it.
One error a trust-breaker makes when attempting to rebuild trust with another, is refusing to take full ownership for what they did. Learn not to blame, project, or minimize what you have done.
You may be deceived if you trust too much, but you will live in torment if you don't trust enough.
Not being able to let go and trust those around you can be incredibly stressful. You will be constantly questioning the actions of those around you, never feel in control and generally unhappy.
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
A man who trusts nobody is apt to be the kind of man nobody trusts.
How can I trust you when you keep on running away every time I untie you?
Raisin cookies that look like chocolate chip cookies are the main reason I have trust issues.
Trust is the easiest thing in the world to lose, and the hardest thing in the world to get back.
People ask me why it's so hard to trust people, and I ask them why is it so hard to keep a promise.
Trust is hard to come by. That's why my circle is small and tight. I'm kind of funny about making new friends.
The trust of the innocent is the liar's most useful tool.
I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.
When someone breaks your trust. Don't feel stupid for trusting them. You didn't do anything wrong, they're just an untrustworthy person.
Trust is like a sticker, once removed, it does not sticky anymore as it did before.
Trust is like blood pressure. It's silent, vital to good health, and if abused it can be deadly.
You must trust and believe in people, or life becomes impossible.
Not everyone can be trusted. I think we all have to be very selective about the people we trust.

Before speaking, consult your inner-truth barometer, and resist the temptation to tell people only what they want to hear.

Sometimes people are afraid of falling in love, because it sometimes comes in a way we never expected.

It is a mistake to think of creative activity as something unusual.
If our solar system is not unusual, then there are so many planets in the universe that, for example, they outnumber the sum of all sounds and words ever uttered by every human who has ever lived. To declare that Earth must be the only planet with life in the universe would be inexcusably bigheaded of us.
Being creative means first of all doing something unusual... On the other hand, however unusual it may be, the idea also has to be reasonable for people to take it seriously.
Only in the most unusual cases is it useful to determine whether a book is good or bad; for it is just as rare for it to be one or the other. It is usually both.
If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.
it is not unusual to hate great writers before we learn to love them. Because they have created something that did not yet exist, they must also create their audience. Sometimes the audience is not yet ready. Sometimes it has yet to be born.
This is a rather unusual situation in physics. We perform approximate calculations which are valid only in some regime and this gives us the exact answer. This is a theorist's heaven- exact results with approximate methods.
It's an unusual opportunity, a chance for so many people to share in the excitement and the fun of the fact that we may be on to hints as to what the Universe is made out of. I guess the whole point of a prize like this is to be able to get that out into the community.
We are not interested in the unusual, but in the usual seen unusually.
Every new experience is unusual. The rest of life is just sleep and committee meetings.

What is unusual about Earth is that language, literally, has become alive. It has infested matter. It is replicating and defining and building itself. And it is in us.

People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.

Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can only be attained through understanding.
The sword of murder is not the balance of justice.
You must show the world that you abhor fighting.
Violence can only be concealed by a lie, and the lie can only be maintained by violence.

Youth is the best time to be rich, and the best time to be poor.
Youth is such a wonderful thing. What a crime to waste it on children.
Youth comes but once in a lifetime.
Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind. You are as old as your doubt, your fear, your despair. The way to keep young is to keep your faith young. Keep your self-confidence young. Keep your hope young.
Youth is about the only thing worth having, and that is about the only thing youth has.
Youth gets together with their materials to build a bridge to the moon or maybe a palace on earth; then in middle age they decide to build a woodshed with them instead.
You are only young once, and if you work it right, once is enough.
We have a powerful potential in our youth, and we must have the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we may direct their power toward good ends.
Who so neglects learning in his youth loses the past and is dead to the future.
A youth with his first cigar makes himself sick; a youth with his first girl makes everybody sick.

Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.
A sensual and intemperate youth translates into an old worn-out body.
Youth is to all the glad season of life; but often only by what it hopes, not by what it attains, or what it escapes.
Youth is not a question of years: one is young or old from birth.
Young people are in a condition like permanent intoxication, because youth is sweet and they are growing.
The deepest definition of youth is life as yet untouched by tragedy.
Youth is ever apt to judge in haste, and lose the medium in the wild extreme.
There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of the people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will have truly defeated age.
One of the signs of passing youth is the birth of a sense of fellowship with other human beings as we take our place among them.
It is not possible for civilization to flow backward while there is youth in the world. Youth may be headstrong, but it will advance its allotted length.
If youth is a defect, it is one we outgrow too soon.
Use your youth so that you may have comfort to remember it when it has forsaken you, and not sigh and grieve at the account thereof.
A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do you know that his future will not be equal to our present?
Youth is, after all, just a moment, but it is the moment, the spark, that you always carry in your heart.
Well, youth is the period of assumed personalities and disguises. It is the time of the sincerely insincere.

Young people are more intelligent and sophisticated.

Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.
If you want to stay young-looking, pick your parents very carefully.
You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair.
Youthfulness is about how you live not when you were born.
The young show the genetic process, the old merely die of it.
All I want to be is very young always and very irresponsible and to feel that my life is my own to live and be happy and die in my own way to please myself.
When we're young, everything is possible; when we're old, possibilities are everything.
The young are permanently in a state resembling intoxication.
To remain always young, we need only do at every age what harmonises with it.
You're young and you have all your life ahead of you.
Young people need pleasure as truly as they need food and air.
When you're young you just run, but you come back to what you need.
It is better to be young in your failures than old in your successes.
Young people have limited choices, but they are also useful human resources.
The young never take anything seriously if it sounds simple.
When you're young, you should live out every weekend. Even if you look like a scarecrow, you just gotta go!

Young is the one that plunges in the future and never looks back.
Young men and young women, full of courage, originality, and genius, are everywhere to be met with.
We're not too young for love, just too young for about everything there is that goes with love.
Youthfulness is not determined by age. It is determined by one's life force. One who possesses hope is forever young. One who continually advances is forever beautiful.
The young man only looks to the future because he has lived little; the old man looks to the past because he has little left to live.
Zen teaches that if we can open up to the inevitability of our demise, we can begin to transform and lighten up about it.
We carry inside us the wonders we seek outside us.

If you have inner peace, nobody can force you to be a slave to the outer reality.
A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.

I'm here to tell you that the path to peace is right there, when you want to get away.
Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.
Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water.

Zen is not an art, it's not a religion. It's a realisation.
You should study not only that you become a mother when your child is born, but also that you become a child.
Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet.
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about.
What was never lost can never be found.
Throughout this life, you can never be certain of living long enough to take another breath.
Life is a journey. Time is a river. The door is ajar.
One who conquers himself is greater than another who conquers a thousand times a thousand on the battlefield.
Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.
Practice is this life, and realization is this life, and this life is revealed right here and now.
Only the hand that erases can write the true thing.
Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively.
Zen is not some kind of excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine.
I come to realize that mind is no other than mountains and rivers and the great wide earth, the sun and the moon and stars.

Zeus most glorious and most great, Thundercloud, throned in the heavens! Let not the sun go down and the darkness come, until I cast down headlong the citadel of Priam in flames, and burn his gates with blazing fire, and tear to rags the shirt upon Hectors breast! May many of his men fall about him prone in the dust and bite the earth!
For know that no one is free, except Zeus.
Bear up, my child, bear up; Zeus who oversees and directs all things is still mighty in heaven.

LIke animals in the jungle, the Zoo has to compete very hard, competing not only with other tourist attractions in Singapore, but also with other zoos in the world.
It is a view of life we should promote in the Zoo. It is a view of life all mankind needs to tackle the problems of the environment, with an understanding that, by complex feedback loops, our actions can destroy us if we are not careful.
The Zoo is now a fantastic and wonderful place, changed beyond recognition from the old collection of fusty Edwardian barns, smelling of elephant droppings.
The public purpose of zoos is to offer visitors the opportunity of looking at animals. Yet nowhere in a zoo can a stranger encounter the look of an animal. At the most, the animal's gaze flickers and passes on. They look sideways. They look blindly beyond.
The city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo.
When animals are confiscated at the airport, sometimes a zoo will take them in, but confiscation happens so frequently that zoos have become saturated with certain species.
Some zoos even explicitly prescribe the sort of looks that visitors should and should not perform.
People want to see animals, and they want to see them doing stuff, living their lives.
The zoos exhibition of domesticated animals is quite different from that of wild animals. Whereas the zoogoer is commonly allowed only to look— not to touch— wild animals, visitor's of children's zoos, especially children, are encouraged to pet the animals.
The life expectancy of zoo animals is three to four times greater than those creatures in wild, who have to fight day after day to survive.
Many people take to animals to escape from human beings— but often it turns out they find the animals so human.
The majority of the animals which are to be found in zoos are those which English speakers would refer to as 'wild', a term which usually stands in opposition to 'domestic.'
Modern zoos are no longer any places that keep a few animals for people to go and look at. They are scientifically run and governmentally regulated institutions, which have a significant role to play in our relationship with the natural world.
Zoos have a major role to play nowadays in raising awareness and education about animals and environmental issues, and we consider this role briefly in so far as it affects the animals and their environment.
But zookeepers also have more unusual responsibilities. You might find yourself playing games with a monkey, imitating a vulture, weighing a snake— even tickling a tapir.
American zoos are visited each year by more than a hundred million people, a number that exceeds the combined attendance of all big league baseball, football, and basketball games.
Caring for zoo animals in not an easy task. All animals have different lifestyles and needs.
We need zoos to connect people with endangered animals, to help them understand these problems and to inspire the need for protection.
The zoo is a pretty safe place to fart.
Zoo animals are ambassadors for their cousins in the wild.
Zoo: An excellent lace to study the habits of human beings.
Zoos should concentrate more on the preservation side of things.
People forget the good that zoos do. If it weren't for zoos, we would have so many species that would be extinct today.
A zoo is a good place to make a spectacle of yourself, as the people around you have creepier, more photogenic things to look at.
The city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo.
Zoos are becoming facsimiles or perhaps caricatures of how animals once were in their natural habitat. If the right policies toward nature were pursued, we would need no zoos at all.
The best protection against risk is knowing what you are doing.
Zoo is an artificial territory, an approximation. Civilization is our natural territory.
Work like you don’t need the money. Love like you’ve never been hurt. Dance like nobody’s watching.
When you dance, you can enjoy the luxury of being you.
Every day brings a chance for you to draw in a breath, kick off your shoes, and dance.
Do it big, do it right, and do it with style.
Get up and dance, get up and smile, get up and drink to the days that are gone in the shortest while.
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.
A fit, healthy body that is the best fashion statement.
All that is important is this one moment in movement. Make the moment important, vital, and worth living. Do not let it slip away unnoticed and unused.
To dance is to be out of yourself. Larger, more beautiful, more powerful. 
The one thing that can solve most of our problems is dancing.
When the melody plays, footsteps move, heart sings and spirit begin to dance.
Zumba is a great way to exercise and fellowship with other people in a fun atmosphere!
Dance is that delicacy of life radiating every particle of our existence with happiness.
Oh my God, Zumba is the greatest invention ever for women. I like to exercise, though I do nothing consistently because I get bored and impatient. With Zumba, you're dancing, you're moving your hips. So much fun.
Zumba has been a fun alternative to traditional exercise. I love the upbeat music too!
One step, two steps, three steps; like winds of time experience joy of centuries, when movements become revelations of the dance of destinies.
I like doing Zumba. I only do it like, once a week. If I did it more often, I would be very skinny.
